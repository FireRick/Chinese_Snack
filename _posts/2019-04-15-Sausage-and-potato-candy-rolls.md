# Introduction

**"My little girl doesn't look fat, she's under four years old, but she's a solid carnivore, and she has a good digestive ability. She doesn't have to worry about what she'll accumulate. Usually, beef, pork and fish are often cooked for her. Sometimes she goes out to see barbecue sausages that she has to buy. Sometimes she can't buy a sausage to relieve her*The ingredients of noodles are additives, which are not good for children. This time, I saw Jenny Jean's children's sausage and meatballs come on the market. I bought a box for my family to taste fresh as soon as possible. I believe this truth. It shows that water-soluble dietary fiber has been added and no preservatives have been added.With steamed potatoes, children's sausages, put carrots, mushrooms, take to cook the ingredients out of the fragrance, but also to more fully stimulate the nutrients in carrots and mushrooms, because sausages are not half-cooked products in the world, this must be frozen preservation, so it must be steamed, roasted or cut into pieces, fried with carrots, mushrooms, steamed, put into steamed cooked.My wife ate eight sausage and candy rolls in a single breath. If she didn't say she wanted to leave some for her brother, she would continue to eat. She kept saying, "Mom, it's so delicious. Next time she'll cook it for me!"**

# Tips

1. The fillings are prepared according to their own demand. I do more.2. The stuffing in candy rolls can be changed into bean paste, meat stuffing and other stuffing that you like.3. The skin that can be changed into fried will be more crisp, but fried more oil-saving, eat healthier, according to their preferences to choose fried or fried.
