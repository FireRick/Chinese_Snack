# Tips

1. When the batter is poured into the pot, it must be stirred continuously. Otherwise, some batter will not be boiled and scattered, which will affect the taste (when I am busy taking pictures, there will be some caking).2. Generally, it will be better after cooling. Five or six hours will be suitable.
