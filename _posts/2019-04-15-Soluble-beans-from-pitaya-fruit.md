# Introduction

**"This time, we made the soluble beans of Pitaya fruit. When we made the soluble beans, it had a great relationship with the milk powder. I changed the milk powder this time, a little defoaming, but it did not affect the taste at all. Everyone tried to use a part of the milk powder, no other part can be used, the concentration of defoaming under the adjustment is not so strong. Today, I made pitaya fruit, you can use any joy.Replace it with Huan's fruit and vegetable puree."**
