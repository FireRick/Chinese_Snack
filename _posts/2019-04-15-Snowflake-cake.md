Pour into the corn starch milk mixture which is stirred evenly. Turn to low heat (300w in the induction cooker) and keep stirring with shovels to prevent pasting the bottom.

# Tips

If there is no liquid pure milk, you can also use milk powder to make it - 500 ml warm water, with appropriate amount of milk powder (more milk powder, more strong milk flavor; less milk powder, less milk flavor) also divided into two parts, one boiled in an inverted pot, one starched with corn.Here we should pay attention to whether white sugar is added or only a little if the milk powder itself is sweet.
