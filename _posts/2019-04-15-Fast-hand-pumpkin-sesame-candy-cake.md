# Steps

## step 1:

Pumpkin peeled and sliced.Put it in a deep dish, add 1 tablespoon of water, and steam the pumpkin in a microwave oven in the mode of steaming fish.Putting a little water just prevents the steaming process from getting too dry or not. The time is set by the thickness of pumpkin or the function of microwave oven.The ripe pumpkin is put into the cup of the feeder.

## step 2:

Add glutinous rice flour and dipped rice flour, add 80 grams of milk first, stir with a manual egg beater, if too thick, then add appropriate amount of milk.I added about 100 grams.Because the water content of pumpkin mud is different, the amount of water or milk added is also different.
