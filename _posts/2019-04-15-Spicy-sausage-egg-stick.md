# Spicy sausage egg stick

# Introduction

**"There are three peppery sausages left. It's boring to fry them directly.There's an egg cup for breakfast. Why not have an egg sausage - a whole piece of spicy sausage put into the egg cup, and then pour into the egg juice. When the egg juice is heated and solidified, it will put a golden coat on the spicy sausage.It's nice to imagine, but it's hard to pinch how many eggs are needed to properly wrap the spicy sausage from head to tail.The first intestine made an attempt, pouring out about half of the egg's liquid. When the chili sausage rose, it was obvious that it could not be completely wrapped.Then one and a half of the remaining egg liquid was allocated to the remaining two spicy sausages, and then the spicy sausage egg stick could not see the intestine.The effect seems very good, but there are still some drawbacks: the end of the egg stick is exposed at last, once it is separated from the egg cup, it will immediately be cold and shrink, it looks wrinkled and not full at all.Golden egg sausage is much more interesting than eating directly with a bowel.**
