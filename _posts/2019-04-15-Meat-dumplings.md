# Tips

1. All dosage can be adjusted according to personal taste. I'm from the north, so white granulated sugar is less put.Ginger powder can also be left alone.Meat depends more or less on preference.2. I use old bamboo leaves, which are bigger, so one piece is enough.If fresh leaves are used, they must be boiled in water and sterilized.Narrow blades can be adjusted according to the actual situation.3. If you boil it in a normal boiling pot, cook it in cold water, then turn it to a low heat and cook it for 3 hours.
