# Tips

1. You can't use ordinary casserole to make popcorn. I use black music casserole which is dry-burning, quick-cold and unbreakable, so it's OK.2. The corn used for popcorn should be small-grained corn, which should be popped more openly and put sugar powder in step 5. It can prevent the pot from turning black and the popcorn from turning black.3. It's not good to put sugar first. The corn is not heated yet. Sugar melts first. Sugar becomes pasty at high temperature. Popcorn is black, and the burnt sugar is bitter, so it's not good to eat.4. Butter and butter can be chosen for those who like the flavor of butter, or sugar powder can be changed into milk powder, and instant coffee powder can be used for those who like the flavor of coffee...As long as the seasoning powder is put after, you can change your taste, whatever you want to eat.5. If there is no sugar powder, you can put ice sugar into the machine to make powder.
