![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/431793/13.jpg)

## step 14:

Take it out and put it in a container (if there is no non-stick container, you can use a bowl, but you need to brush the oil to remove the film easily).

## step 15:

If the pressing force is not tight, the cutting time is easy to disperse.

## step 16:

After pressing, the film can be removed with slight warmth.
