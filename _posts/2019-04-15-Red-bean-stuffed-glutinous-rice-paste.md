# Tips

Do it with gloves to prevent sticking hands.The fresh glutinous rice paste tastes best. It's better not to stay overnight. It will become dry and hard after overnight. If you don't want to eat it the next day, you can put microwave in Shanghai to heat it before eating, and it will become soft immediately. The taste is also good.
