# Introduction

**"I do this in Japanese style, but the brine is Chinese style.People who have eaten Japanese Ramen must have eaten two thin pieces of meat rolls in ramen, fat but not greasy. The taste of instant entrance makes people want to eat more. But Japanese cuisine is very delicate. It feels a little insufficient to eat. They can make it at home and eat enough.**
