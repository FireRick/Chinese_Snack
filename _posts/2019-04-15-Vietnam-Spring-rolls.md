# Introduction

**"I love Vietnamese food.Spring roll skin as thin as cicada wings, hot rice flour of all kinds of fresh vegetables, dripping coffee...Let people linger and forget to return.I have bought spring roll skins in Vietnam, but the wrapping effect is not good.This spring roll is tough enough and easy to wrap, but it's still not well wrapped. Let's do that. The taste of sweet and spicy sauce is authentic.**
