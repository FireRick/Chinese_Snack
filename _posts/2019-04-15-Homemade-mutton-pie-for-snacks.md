# Introduction

**"As a girl, what she has to do with gourmet food all her life is to lose weight and control her stomach to eat more gourmet food for the sake of gourmet food.With the pressure of work, I can't help eating snacks to reward my wronged self. I like dumplings, but I can't break the delicious mutton filling in the face of reducing fat and controlling staple food.So I had a sudden idea of making a mini mutton pie, but I didn't expect to succeed.It's much better than eating small cakes. If you want to relieve your appetite and don't like sweet food, you can consider doing it.Lazy people lose fat snacks, mutton can be replaced by beef or pork, the important thing is that dumplings made of meat with animal fat like dumplings are more fragrant, and mini mutton pie is the same.What's better than dumplings is that they are greasy when they are eaten with more fat than dumplings, but not when they are greasy.**
