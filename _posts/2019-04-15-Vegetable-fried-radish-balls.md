# Tips

1. Salted shredded radish has a certain salinity. When seasoning, we should pay attention to whether to add salt according to our own taste.2. When starch is added, it should be added slowly to reach the consistency. If the amount of food is large, the amount of egg white can be increased appropriately or the turnip juice can be added to the consistency.3. When the remaining oil is used to stir-fry again, because it is already cooked oil, hot oil can stir-fry in a frying pan to avoid repeated high temperature.
