# Introduction

**"Occasionally in the market, steamed buns steamed with green beans and fresh yellow corn pulp are green, yellow, fresh and tender, and very fresh.All of a sudden, it was a pity that the golden fruit corn had been used up.In spite of replenishing the warehouse, a great deal of white waxy corn came in at once.When dealing with this waxy corn, we found that there was a small package of green beans left unused in the refrigerator, so we used waxy corn and green beans to make a cake, but the color was greener.Green beans reduce the stickiness of waxy corn, and the amount of flour is less than that of pure waxy corn.However, the reduction of flour will also weaken the softness of the cake.However, it is said that the green beans and corn buns sold on the market do not have any additional additives, just pure green beans and corn.So it doesn't matter if it's not so soft.The baking powder version of the cake is the most convenient, the cake out of the pot looks good, shallow green, some light yellow millet grains scattered in the meantime, it is not completely broken corn germ...Very delicate fragrance...**
