# Steps

## step 1:

Black rice and glutinous rice soak more than two hours in advance, the proportion of individual like it, I probably 1:1.No good picture.Poached rice is simple and should not affect the production.Wash the lotus root and cut one end into pieces.Lotus root should be chosen as straight as possible, with large holes and no broken ends.

## step 2:

Put the soaked rice into the lotus root hole and use chopsticks. It's faster and full, but don't press it too hard.

## step 3:

After stuffing, cover the cut lotus root and fix it with toothpicks. I only inserted two toothpicks, which may not be visible.In the pot, add brown sugar water to end the lotus root. I also put some on the lotus root.It's better to finish the lotus root with brown sugar water. I put less in it and flipped it once in the middle.Stew as long as possible and it's softer.

## step 4:

After stewing the brown sugar water to a thick consistency, let it cool slightly, slice it and pour over the remaining brown sugar water in the pot.It's delicious.
