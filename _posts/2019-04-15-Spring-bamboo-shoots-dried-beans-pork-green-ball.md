## step 1:

Remove old and yellow leaves from fresh argyi grass, soak them in salt water for 3 minutes, remove floating dust, and rinse them with clean water.

## step 2:

Cook in a boiling pot, discolor, remove and cool naturally.

![step 2]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/2.jpg)

## step 3:

After boiling the water, I weighed the mugwort, weighing about 260 grams. I cut the mugwort into small pieces and put them into the broken wall cooking machine. Then I poured 320 grams of cold water into the pulp. The amount of water can be adjusted according to the amount of young leagues to be done, a little more can be done.

## step 4:

Prepare a piece of gauze, pour the moxa straw pulp into the gauze, extrude the moxa straw juice, and leave the residue for its use.

## step 5:

Material ready for making green peel: Moxa juice, glutinous rice powder, crystal powder is also wheat starch (clear surface), add some can increase the taste of Q-bullet;

![step 5]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/5.jpg)

## step 6:

Take about 35 grams of wheat starch, blanch it with 30 grams of hot water, and mix it into a ball. The heated wheat starch is very sticky, and the skin will not crack; I use the water in the hot pot, because it is only about 80 degrees for a period of time, if it is flushed with boiling water, the wheat starch will be blanched and transparent, and the adhesion will be stronger after it is put into the glutinous rice dough.

![step 6]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/6.jpg)

## step 7:

Put the wheat starch into the glutinous rice flour, and pour the argyrophyll juice into it. The glutinous rice flour is more watery. I weighed it. Among 300 grams of glutinous rice flour, I poured 275 grams of argyrophyll juice.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/7.jpg)

## step 8:

First stir chopsticks into pieces, then hand knead into a ball, if too dry can pour some mugwort juice, can knead into a smooth glutinous rice ball, covered with preservative film for a while;

## step 9:

When making dough, we should deal with fillings: sliced pork fillings, chopped bamboo shoots, dried white tofu, chopped small dices after 10 minutes to remove astringency. The dosage is not fixed, according to their own preferences and packaging techniques to decide;

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Pour a little oil in the frying pan, first stir-fry pork to change its color to fragrance, then mix with soy sauce; then stir-fry spring bamboo shoots and tofu dried, sprinkle with salt, until the water is dry, turn off the fire, and cool.

## step 11:

The preserved mugwort glutinous rice dumplings were weighed into 12 parts, each weighing about 50, and the quantity was determined according to their own preferences. The final size of the dumplings was determined by weight and technique.

## step 12:

Flatten the small glutinous rice balls, slightly thinner edges, with the palm nest into a small bowl, take appropriate filling on top;

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/12.jpg)

## step 13:

Close the edge of the skin to the center and pinch it tightly. There is no fixed wrapping method, as long as the filling is not leaked.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/13.jpg)

## step 14:

Put a piece of grease paper on the bottom and put it on the steamer. I use the steamer. It's OK to use the ordinary big steamer.

![step 14]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/14.jpg)

## step 15:

Put the steamer with the Youth League into the steamer, 100 degrees, 15 minutes from in to out.

![step 15]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/15.jpg)

## step 16:

After steaming, a thin layer of vegetable oil is brushed on the surface to prevent the skin from evaporating, drying and cracking, and at the same time to prevent sticky hands.Hot or cold food can be eaten, there will be different flavors.

![step 16]({{site.baseurl}}/img/451638/16.jpg)

## step 17:

The green ball with thin skin and big stuffing, the stuffing is delicious and salty, how can we not eat enough?

# Tips

1. Making Green League leather can be all made of glutinous rice flour, the taste is soft and waxy, add some wheat starch, can taste more Q-elastic; use hot water and wheat starch to increase viscosity; 2. Mugwort juice can be filtered or used directly, with mugwort pulp and noodles, the color will be darker, not as light as using juice.
