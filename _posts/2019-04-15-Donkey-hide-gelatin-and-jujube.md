# Introduction

**As the saying goes, "Qi, blood and feet are beautiful in appearance", the effect of cosmetics for external use is not as good as that of tonics for internal use.Autumn and winter is a good time for women to warm and invigorate their Qi and blood.Speaking of women's maintenance, we all think of the traditional blood tonic products - gelatin and brown sugar.Today, I am going to make this kind of Ajiao honey jujube, which is made of "Ajiao brown sugar" and red jujube in Ganju Garden.Compared with raw jujube, ripe jujube not only tastes sweet, but also is easier to digest and absorb, and has a better blood tonic function than raw jujube.It's not too much trouble. Let's take a look at it next.**

# Steps

## step 1:

Prepare jujube and gum brown sugar.The ripened E-gelatin is ground into powder and added to brown sugar, which is more easily absorbed by human body, and has no odor and better taste.

## step 2:

Clean the jujube with water.If the jujube is dry, soak it for a while to remove impurities in the folds.Tip: The traditional way is to soak the jujube with edible alkali water.In fact, the human body will not be affected by the intake of food acidity and alkalinity changes in the body, many of the current "food acidity and alkalinity" is not scientific.

## step 5:

Add gum brown sugar and water to the pot and boil over high heat.The amount of water is slightly more than that of jujube.At this time, there will be a little foam on the side of the pan, which is an impurity in donkey hide gelatin brown sugar.Some friends use that kind of "manual brown sugar", if the purification process is not in place, there will be a lot of impurities.

After boiling, change to small fire, do not stir frequently in the middle, so as not to crush the jujube.Boil for about 20 minutes, according to the size of the pot and the amount of water, increase or decrease as appropriate.
