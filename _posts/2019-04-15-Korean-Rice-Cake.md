## step 2:

New Year's Cake contains New Year's Cake, and a bag of sweet and spicy sauce. The sauce is spicy. If you give it to children, you can change the tomato sauce or the taste you like. The New Year's Cake tastes good.

## step 3:

Cook the rice cake in cold water for 3-5 minutes until the rice cake becomes soft. Pour out more water than you can get. Leave a proper amount of water (the rice cake should not stick to the pot). The following pictures are made before.
