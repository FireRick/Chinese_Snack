## step 10:

## step 11:

Stir-fry in an oil-free, salt-free, non-stick pan over low heat, without preheating the pan, or it will be easy to stir-fry until the surface is slightly golden. The whole process will take about four or five minutes.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/406729/11.jpg)

## step 12:

Fill in the machine, not too full, take out the cup for five seconds and mix it upside down. Keep beating for a few seconds. Don't break it too much, or it will be crushed.

## step 13:

At this time, the meat floss should be touched by hand, a little moist, pour into the non-stick pan and continue to stir-fry for about three or four minutes. If it feels not very moist, you can turn off the fire.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/406729/13.jpg)

## step 14:

Well, the original meat floss is ready, because the baby under one year old can't eat oil and salt, so nothing is added. If the baby eats it, it can add raw soy sauce, sugar and oil consumption to fry it. The color is better.
