Salted duck eggs are marinated with a little white wine to remove the fishy smell.

## step 3:

Prepare five-centimeter diced pork, add a spoon of soy sauce, half a spoon of oyster sauce, a spoon of sugar, a spoon of salt, a spoon of spicy powder, a spoon of liquor, and marinate it for more than four small sizes.

## step 4:

Soak glutinous rice in water for 4 hours, add two spoons of liquor, two spoons of soy sauce, one spoon of oyster sauce and two spoons of salt to marinate.(Actually, I also put dried scallops, but dried scallops are not suitable for cold food. Steaming hot is not fishy. It is recommended not to put them in.)

## step 5:

According to personal preferences, wrap into triangular zongzi or quadrangular long zongzi or other shapes.Remember to boil the water and then put in the zongzi, I used the pressure cooker and the frying pan to cook.1. Put the zongzi in the pressure cooker, and then pour it into the hot water level without the zongzi. Turn to medium-low heat after steaming. Press the zongzi 60-90 minutes according to the size of the zongzi. 2. Add hot water into the frying pan without the zongzi, and turn to medium-low heat after boiling for 3-4 hours.

## step 6:

This is the zongzi after 90 minutes in the high-pressure cooker. The frying pan is not sticky for 90 minutes. It's loose. It's only two and a half hours before this effect.

It's great to eat while it's hot!
