# Tips

1. Thin cut pork is easy to taste, and spiced wine can remove the fishy smell.2. Beans are easy to be poisoned if they are not ripe, so when they are stir-fried, they can be stir-fried for a while to accelerate the ripening speed.3. If the soup is too little when baking noodles, it can be stirred in the middle with a little hot water.
