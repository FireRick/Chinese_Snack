# Tips

Answer: Why is it better to choose lean tenderloin instead of meat stuffing with fat?Because the fat meat melts in the roast and produces a lot of sauce.Too much oil is not conducive to the color of dried meat.In the process, we need to pour out the excess oil and use kitchen paper to absorb the oil on the surface of the meat.
