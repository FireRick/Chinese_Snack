I found that the ingredient list was ordinary glutinous rice flour, soybean noodles and bean paste. It was very simple. So, this time, the delicious gentleman made it at home by himself.In the morning, I went to the vegetable market and bought some ingredients. When I came back, I steamed the glutinous rice flour and fried the soybean flour. I rolled some bean paste and sprinkled some soybean flour to decorate it.
