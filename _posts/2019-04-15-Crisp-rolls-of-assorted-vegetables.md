# Introduction

**"I am embarrassed to say that this is the end of the food left over from the Mid-Autumn Festival. In order to make friends eat happier, I changed the way to make it on the table, so that the same food has totally different taste and style. Friends can try it if they like.In order to get better oil, I use a milk pan to fry the rolls, so that I can fry the crisp rolls well with less oil.**
