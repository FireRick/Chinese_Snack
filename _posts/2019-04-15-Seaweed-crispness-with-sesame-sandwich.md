# Introduction

**"This seaweed crisp sesame sandwich made today is the second bake of ACA intelligent oven E43A. It is baked in a 100-degree low-temperature baking mode. Low-temperature baking can maximize the nutritional content of the food, but also make the color of the food more original and beautiful. The baked product tastes very crisp, with sesame in the middle, and also very fragrant.My baby is three and a half years old, and can't stop eating.Homemade snacks, give children more comfort to eat.I use two baking pans to press the operation. I press one baking pan on the top for half an hour, so as to make the finished product smoother and more perfect.Of course, not pressing the baking tray is also possible, flatness will have a slight impact only, taste will not have an impact.**

## step 4:

Take two pieces of seaweed, brush each rough side with mixed juice, and evenly sprinkle a layer of sesame on the surface.The amount of sesame is not too much, one side of the bonding is not good, I used a piece of seaweed about 10 grams.

## step 5:

Cover the other piece and pay attention to brushing the side of the sauce facing inside so that it can bond well. Roll the sauce from west to west with a rolling pin, so it will be smoother.
