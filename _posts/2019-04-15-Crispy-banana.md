# Tips

1. When banana hangs batter, first mix flour and starch into paste with eggs, then hang paste, which is more uniform and convenient than directly dipping egg liquid and then wrapping flour.Starch and flour are generally 2:1.2. Bananas should not use the kind that is too soft and too ripe.3. Fried bananas should be eaten while they are hot. They taste best.
