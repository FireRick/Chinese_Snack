# Steps

## step 1:

First add 100 ml of water to the milk pot, then boil the sugar and pour it in. Cook until the sugar is completely melted, then leave the fire.

## step 2:

Slowly pour the boiled syrup into the glutinous rice flour, stirring with chopsticks while inverted, stirring until the glutinous rice flour absorbs the syrup completely, and then knead it into a soft dough by hand. The glutinous rice flour is more sticky, so you remember to wear a glove to operate.

## step 3:

The kneaded dough is still slightly sticky. Add a small spoonful of oil and knead it into the dough.

## step 4:

After oiling, the dough will be smoother, less sticky, and then put into a fresh bag to relax for 30 minutes.

## step 5:

When the dough is loose, it can be taken out and used. Now sprinkle some hand powder on the table to prevent sticking. Then rub the dough into strips and cut it into small dough of even size.

## step 6:

Then use the palm to form a round little ball. My formula is just the amount of 20 small balls. You can also make a bigger one.

## step 7:

Now the weather is dry and the dough skin is easy to air-dry, so I covered it with a fresh-keeping film.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/430412/7.jpg)

## step 8:

Then I'll prepare the bean paste stuffing. I'll buy the bean paste stuffing directly and cut it into equal pieces. I'll just rub it round.

![step 8]({{site.baseurl}}/img/430412/8.jpg)

## step 9:

Then wrap the bean paste stuffing in the glutinous rice dough, and the reunion will be OK.

## step 10:

When the filling is finished, put it in the sesame and roll on a layer of sesame grains. Then you can prepare the dough.

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/430412/10.jpg)

## step 11:

Pour a proper amount of oil into the pan and heat it to 5-6 minutes on a small fire. When you insert chopsticks, you can see a lot of dense bubbles, which means that the oil temperature is OK and the pan can be lowered.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/430412/11.jpg)

## step 12:

When the dough first comes out of the pot, it sinks in the bottom of the pot. You should use chopsticks to move it to prevent sticking to the bottom.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/430412/12.jpg)

## step 13:

Deep-fried dough began to float on the surface, to use a filter to press the dough constantly, so that the dough can be uniformly heated in the oil pan expansion dough oil temperature is not suitable for too low, because it will collapse and not easy to expand, if the oil temperature is too high, it is easier to fry, so oil temperature must be well controlled, small fire, keep in a slightly boiling state.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/430412/13.jpg)

## step 14:

When the dough is fried golden on the surface, it will almost come out of the pot. The golden crispness will fragrance far away. After cooling, it will also be fragrant and crisp. It's very delicious.

![step 14]({{site.baseurl}}/img/430412/14.jpg)

## step 15:

The golden crisp shell, together with the soft, sticky and sweet glutinous inside, as well as the surface full of sesame, bite down, click, sweet bean paste filling into the mouth.
