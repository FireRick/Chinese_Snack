# Tips

/ Shrimp/1. Don't throw away the shrimp head. You can fry the shrimp oil and boil the soup with water. It's good to boil noodles or winter Yingong.2. The position of shrimp belly must be cut several knives and then gently press the shrimp tendon to prevent the shrimp from being heated and rolled up in the process of frying.3. After a little shrimp tail is cut off, the water in the shrimp tail can be scraped, so that the water will not explode too much in the oil when frying shrimp./ Paste/1, in addition to flour and baking powder in the batter, the weight of the seasoning can be adjusted according to personal preferences.2. The weight of eggs is about 60 g (with shell weight).3. Different brands have different water absorption, so milk should be added a little more than once. The consistency of the batter should be raised and dripped with lines, which will gradually disappear./ Oil temperature/1 and oil temperature can be tested with wooden chopsticks as well as breadcrumbs.When chopsticks are put into oil, tiny bubbles will come out slowly.2. Oil temperature should not be too high, otherwise shrimp will be deep-fried in a few minutes, and the shrimp inside is not ripe.3. Oil temperature should not be too low. Food fried at too low oil temperature will be very oily and not crisp.
