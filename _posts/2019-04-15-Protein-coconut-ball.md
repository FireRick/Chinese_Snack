# Tips

1. Coconut ball should be the same size as possible, so that the degree of baking is almost the same.2. When kneading balls, it is recommended to wear disposable silica gel gloves for baking, so as not to stick hands.3. The baking time is also related to the size of the coconut ball, so it can be adjusted by itself.
