# Steps

## step 1:

Mix the flour with sugar. Start beating three eggs into the flour. When mixing the flour, you feel that there is not enough liquid. Then you pour another egg into the flour, sharing four eggs and noodles.

## step 2:

The dough is sticky when it's not dry flour.

## step 3:

Add vegetable oil.

## step 4:

Continue mixing until vegetable oil is fully absorbed, dough is soft and smooth, and refrigerate overnight.

## step 5:

The next morning, take out the dough and knead it. It's very smooth.

## step 6:

Twist the dough into long strips and divide it into small parts. Take one and twist it slowly.

## step 7:

Each hand holds one end of noodles, reverse upward, fold again, natural mapping of twists and turns.(I operate by myself, with both hands occupied, so I can't take pictures) and then work backwards.

## step 8:

Then fold it in half, close it and plug it, and a hemp-peanut embryo will be ready.

## step 9:

Do the rest in turn. Cover the hemp peanut embryos with a fresh-keeping film and relax for a few minutes.

## step 10:

Add more oil in the pan, and fry the hemp peanut embryos slowly under low heat when the oil temperature is 34% hot.

## step 11:

The twist grew bigger and floated.

## step 12:

Deep-fry for a while. The surface is golden and the color is even.Fried twists are fished out and put on kitchen paper to absorb excess oil.

## step 13:

Although the finished product is not hairy, and its taste is not as soft as hairy, it uses eggs and noodles. The twist is fluffy and the taste is between crisp twist and soft twist.
