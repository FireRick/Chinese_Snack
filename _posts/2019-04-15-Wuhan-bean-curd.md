# Steps

## step 1:

Soak glutinous rice in a pot and steamed.I use rice cooker, soaking time and cooking water according to the quality of glutinous rice to adjust, can not be hard or too soft, and their preferences related, you can try several times (200 g meters) can be made two pots.

## step 2:

Other ingredients cut into dices, meat and mushrooms will shrink, can be sliced a little bit larger, I dried this fragrance and eggs cut too big, next time can be cut twice as small (about 6 mm square) of small particles.

## step 3:

The pan is heated without oil. The mushrooms and beef are fried and dried in the pan to remove the flavor.

## step 5:

Add brine, anise powder and ginger powder, mix well, add water and cook together for about 15 minutes.The brine is my mother-in-law's usual stewed vegetables, there is a layer of lard, put in very good.If the whole is too weak, we can put some old smoking.

## step 6:

Start the pan and leave more soup.So many materials can be used with four pots.

## step 7:

Mixing Skin: Medium gluten flour (flour made from dumplings and steamed bread at home) mixed with water into paste, thinner than yogurt.My ratio is 100g noodles, 200g water, two pieces of skin can be ironed.

## step 8:

The pan is heated and brushed with oil (the oil always goes astray when it is poured into the pan, so I just bought a silicone oil brush). Then I pour the batter into the pan and round it.Eggs are scattered (no need to beat too evenly, just a little scattered), and when the white of the face is discolored, you can pour the eggs, and the eggs are scalded evenly (roughly even).When the egg liquid solidifies, the dough can be turned over. When turning over, add some oil to the pot.One skin with a smaller egg.

## step 9:

Spread cooked glutinous rice and ingredients on the side without egg juice, and sprinkle with soup.(slow action, can turn off the fire operation)

## step 10:

Fry it a little, turn it over (when testing kungfu), then fry it again and press it with a spade.Divide it into pieces, and I use a Western knife to divide it into pieces (the second time the picture was made, the material laying position was different, the first time I forgot to take the photo of the flip).
