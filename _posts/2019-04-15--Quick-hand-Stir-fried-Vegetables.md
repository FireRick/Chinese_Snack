# Introduction

**"Cantonese call sweet potatoes as sweet potatoes, often used to boil sugar water.Sweetness of sweet potatoes is the highest in autumn and winter.In fact, the air frying pan does not necessarily make the dishes feel fried. It can be roasted at a relatively low temperature. It is soft and not rotten.Eating sweet potatoes reminds me that one of the roles of Xiaolubao, an old Japanese cartoon, is selling sweet potatoes.**
