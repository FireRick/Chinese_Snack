## step 2:

Nuts are crushed and rolled into sushi.Nuts are rich in nutrients and have the effect of brain-tonifying and brain-strengthening. Walnuts are common. Therefore, eating nuts can improve brain nutrition and play the role of brain-tonifying and brain-strengthening.Eating more nuts can also improve eyesight. Chewing nuts every day can help improve chewing function, thus indirectly helping to protect eyesight.

# Tips

The highlight of this sushi is on our rice. It's really a grain of Q-bomb. It's full of fragrance. Let's make it quickly. Sushi is the first choice for breakfast. It's not only dishes, but also meals, and nuts. The nutritional mix is very reasonable. A nutty sushi day starts with a nutty sushi.
