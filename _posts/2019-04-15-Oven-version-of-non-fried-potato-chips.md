# Introduction

**"The weather suddenly turned cool and the playground of the rake changed from outdoor to indoor. The small amusement park in nearby KFC was spotted by the little fellows. As long as they passed by, they played on the slide noisily. Occasionally, they ordered French fries to eat the rake. However, the high fat content of fried food is actually harmful to children's health. At this time, it is better to consider non-fried fries and not greasy.Two potatoes can make a big plate!"**
