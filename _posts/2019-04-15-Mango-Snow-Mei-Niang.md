# Introduction

**"Snow Mei Niang is white, soft and waxy. The first bite is a special Q-slippery ice skin, which is filled with mild cream and wrapped in delicious fruit grains. It is sour, sweet and rich in taste."Snow Mei Niang" has a better taste after refrigeration. She takes a gentle mouthful and has a subtle sweetness and coolness in her softness.**
