# Steps

## step 1:

First, chop the chicken breast with a proper amount of scallions (scallions need not be too much, mainly for seasoning, if you like to eat scallions, small partners can put more, depending on personal taste) together, I did not use the cooking machine, because the hand-chopped meat and the mixing machine taste very different (if you want to save the details, you can also use the cooking machine).

## step 2:

Cut to this extent, like to bite meat texture of the companion can not be chopped so broken (personal feeling is more delicious and easy to ripen).

## step 3:

I use big shrimp, bigger, go head and tail peeling shrimp thread, and then chop shrimp meat, personal feeling after chopping is the kind of small granular, maybe shrimp itself Q-bomb reasons.

## step 4:

Corn kernels are frozen from supermarkets. When they are thawed, they are washed and chopped with clean water. When carrots are chopped, I use a wire-brushing tool to scrape them into silk and then chop them, because I don't like the taste of raw carrots.

## step 5:

Put chopped chicken, shrimp, corn and carrot together, add an egg white. I chose a small egg, only used egg white (which will make the fried chicken tender), then put a proper amount of salt and pepper, a little starch will prevent the food from dispersing in the process of frying, and stir evenly in one direction (the longer the stirring time, the more Q-bullet, the more must be toward one).Stir in the direction, or you'll lose all your previous work.

## step 6:

My family does not have a very flat plate, so we use the usual dish, which is packed with a fresh-keeping film, and then spread a thin layer of edible oil on the film (to prevent freezing and sticking together), spread the prepared meat on the film, and put it in the refrigerator for several hours (must be frozen, otherwise it is difficult to form a block).

## step 7:

Take it out from the refrigerator and cut it into pieces directly on the board. It's not too big. Cut it according to your personal preferences. Remove all the preservative film, dip it in a layer of yolk that you didn't use up before, then wrap it in a layer of chaff and fry it in the pan (don't fire the pan, it's easy to paste), and after all the frying, air it outside and fry it again (big fire oil).It won't take too long to cook once, so it's more crisp. Of course, if you don't feel bothered, you can use it. Then you can make healthy fried chicken nuggets by yourself.
