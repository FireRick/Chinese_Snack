## step 1:

Prepare raw materials, peanuts, water, sugar and weigh them well. Don't be in a hurry when you do it.

## step 2:

Peanuts are laid flat in a baking pan. The whole process of roasting peanuts without oven is the same. Because I want to peel the roasted peanuts, I haven't washed them. If I like the peeled ones, rinse them with flowing water and control the dry water immediately. Don't soak them. It's easy to peel.

## step 3:

The oven does not need preheating to roast directly in the middle of 160 degrees for about 20 minutes. Take out the baking tray and turn the peanuts several times. According to the setting time and temperature of the oven, the baked peanuts will be slightly cooled and crisper.

## step 4:

It's a big project to peel peanuts that are slightly cooled. We can avoid peeling peanuts if we are in trouble.

## step 5:

The sugar and water in the formula are boiled in a non-stick pot and boiled over medium heat until the sugar melts. Sugar can be made of white granulated sugar or soft white sugar. There is nothing particular about it.

## step 6:

When there are very dense bubbles in the pot, the syrup becomes thicker gradually, and the water in the pot evaporates and turns to a small fire.

# Tips

1. Peanut sticky is also called frosting peanut. There are starch and starch versions. I have done both versions. I choose the version I like according to my own preferences.2. Peanuts without oven are cooked in a frying pan all the way. Peeling can be done without peeling. Peeling is a time-consuming task. If you have limited time, don't peel them.3. The syrup is boiled until there are thick bubbles. It's okay to pick up the syrup with a spatula and keep it straight down. Then, don't boil it over to yellow syrup. The final product is not white syrup.
