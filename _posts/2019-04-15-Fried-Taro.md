# Introduction

**"I never had such snacks in my family when I was a child. Once my uncle took our sister and brother to eat, he fell in love with them. Unfortunately, he didn't know how to do it. He didn't know how to do it until he was married for several years.So I learned how simple materials are.**

# Steps

## step 1:

The taro was washed and cut into pieces. The people I bought peeled it off.

## step 2:

Deep-fry in a frying pan. If the shovel can be cut off, it will be cooked. When it is cooked, it will be picked up for reserve.

## step 3:

If the proportion of water and sugar in the pot is 1:2 and half taro, I bought a bigger pot of water, seven spoons of sugar!The water first boils for about ten seconds, then sugar.I love sweet food. If you don't like sweet food, don't overfill it.

## step 4:

Wait until the bubbles are bubbling and then look at the consistency. I was afraid of being blurred. I didn't take a picture of this one. Wait a minute. Push the bubbles away and see that it doesn't look like water.

## step 5:

Turn off the fire and stir-fry the taro in sugar water. Some people like to add onions, but they can also do it!Stir-fry until the sand is turned.That's why I can't grasp the sugar. It's a little pasty, but it doesn't affect the taste.
