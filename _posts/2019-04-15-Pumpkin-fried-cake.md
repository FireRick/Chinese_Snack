# Introduction

**"This morning, we made brown sugar red bean paste filling (very delicate and sweet). Pumpkin was used as the protagonist with waxy powder and flour to make the pumpkin fried cake not only golden in color, moderate in hardness, delicate and sweet, but also waxy in crisp, full of fragrance and bread bran. The pumpkin fried cake was ice-blossom-like and visually impressive."**
