# Introduction

**"Longan is one of my favorite fruits. In July and August, it is the season when longan is on the market in large quantities. Now, every day, one or two kilograms of longan must be eliminated, and the rhythm can not stop when it is eaten.It is rich in glucose, sucrose and protein, iron content is relatively high, can improve heat, nutrition and promote hemoglobin regeneration at the same time, so as to achieve the effect of blood tonic.In addition, longan meat has a beneficial effect on the whole body, especially on brain cells, can enhance memory and eliminate fatigue.And fresh longan is not easy to preserve, easy to deteriorate, for the longan can not be eaten, we can make dried longan, which is commonly known as longan, used for soup pot, soaking, dry eating, and so on, many uses.**
