# Steps

## step 1:

I have steamed this pumpkin paste and sifted it once, so we can use it directly. I pour it into the milk pot and stir-fry the water, sugar, cornstarch, light butter and milk together into the pot.

## step 2:

This corn starch is easy to cake when heated, so before we open fire, we must first mix it into a dry powder state, then open a small fire, boil the pumpkin mud to a thicker and fluidity can be off the fire process with a scraper constantly stirring, otherwise this pumpkin mud is very easy to paste pot.

## step 3:

Then prepare a fresh-keeping box, sprinkle some coconut on the bottom to prevent sticking, then pour the boiled pumpkin mud into it and scrape it flat with a scraper.

## step 5:

When the pumpkin is refrigerated, I take it out, sprinkle it with coconut on the surface, and then force it a little, buckle the box and pop it off.

## step 7:

Finally, the cut small cubes are put into the coconut and rolled in a circle, sticking everything on the side of the coconut, so as to directly mount the plate, a small coconut with a particularly high face value is ready.
