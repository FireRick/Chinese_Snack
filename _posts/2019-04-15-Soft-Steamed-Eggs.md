## step 4:

A good egg liquid is filtered through a sieve or directly removed from the foam and poured into a ceramic or glass tray to remove froth. If the sieve is preferably filtered, it is easy to remove foam and impurities so that the finished water egg will be more delicate and perfect.

# Tips

Steamed eggs, eggs and water ratio is about 1:1.5.When the proportion of eggs is large, the steamed custard is prone to honeycomb; when the proportion of water is large, the custard will be separated from the egg water.Stirring with warm water (about 30 degrees) ensures that nutrition is not lost, and the steamed custard has smooth surface and delicate taste.Don't use deep dishes. Excessive thickness of egg liquid can easily lead to no condensation in the middle.
