## step 5:

After soaking mango slices for 3 hours, they absorb the sugar and salt water sufficiently, so the dried mango baked in this way is not dry.

## step 6:

Take it out and put it on the baking net to cool and dry the surface moisture. This process takes about an hour. It can also be put in the outdoor air in good weather. The moisture is easy to volatilize.

## step 8:

Cool-dried mango slices, put in oven, 130 degrees, top and bottom fire, bake for an hour and a half first.Then turn the upper and lower layers off (to avoid uneven baking) and bake for another hour. At this time, observe the mango slices to see if they are too dry or too wet. If they are too dry, set the temperature to 100 degrees. If they are too wet, bake them for more than half an hour.

## step 9:

After baking for an hour and a half, the dried mango has been preliminarily formed. When the net is exchanged, the mango slices are turned over one by one, so that the dried mango is evenly baked on both sides.
