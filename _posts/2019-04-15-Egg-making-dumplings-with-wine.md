## step 5:

The second step is to put the eggs in the pot. I knock the eggs into the pot directly, pause for two seconds and then stir them in one direction. Part of the egg is shaped into small pieces, and the egg is shaped into fragments. (If the egg is stirred in a bowl before it is put into the pot, the egg will flush very loose, but the egg will not eat the egg.Hotel cooking is usually done in order to save costs.

## step 6:

After stirring the eggs, you can immediately operate the third step: put in brown sugar to melt quickly, then adjust to low fire.Wolfberry can be put into the pot (wolfberry should not be boiled in the pot for too long).

## step 7:

If we want to make Lantern Festival or small balls, the same is true for children who don't like to eat Tangyuan shoes. It's also delicious to make eggs without Tangyuan wine.
