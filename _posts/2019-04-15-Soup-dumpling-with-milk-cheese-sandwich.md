# Introduction

**"Most of the dumplings we used to eat were sesame stuffed, peanut stuffed, fruit stuffed and so on. Every time they were boiled, the children said that they were too sweet and tired to eat at most two. My two babies liked cheese, so we also kept many kinds of cheese at home. Today, on a whim, we wrapped them dumplings with this kind of cheese sandwich, because the cheese itself brought milk fragrance plus one.Salty, not sweet, not greasy, I also added some sugar powder into it, combined, like to eat cheese children, will certainly like it very much.**

# Tips

The dough made of glutinous rice flour has no toughness, and it will be separated when it is gently broken.Here's a trick: You can take a small amount of glutinous rice flour (about 1:10) and knead a small ball, then cook it in boiling water, and then add it to the rest of the glutinous rice flour and add water to knead into a ball, so it's not so easy to crack.Because the cooked glutinous rice dough will become very sticky, it is like a binder, the whole dough will become very soft cotton elastic; it should be noted that the small glutinous rice dough is not too big, oh, a small pinch can be.
