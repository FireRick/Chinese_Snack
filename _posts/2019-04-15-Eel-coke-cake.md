The soft mashed potatoes with onions and meat were fried in a frying pan to make it golden in appearance, crisp in appearance, and golden in color. The steps were simple enough for us to do it at home.The ingredients in cola cakes can be improved according to personal preferences. They can be fried or fried. The shape can also change with one's own mind. The raw materials in the cakes can be replaced except potatoes. Today, the meat fillings are replaced by eels. There are surprises in the cakes.
