# Introduction

**"Now I'm in the habit of sunning my breakfast every day, so when I'm free, I have to think about what I'll eat tomorrow.Well, I haven't eaten bread for several days, so when I'm free today, I can scoop up two bowls of noodles and let the bread machine rub them. It saves me a lot of trouble.Skillfully use the bread machine, knead out the glove film, bread eating soft and chewy, make a few small hamburgers, adults and children eat more energetic!We all know that bread made with high gluten flour is delicious, but it does not need that long wire drawing to make small bread, so I added a small amount of low gluten flour to increase the softness of bread.The recipe is right, but it can still hold out a beautiful glove film.Bread directly or jam, sausage and eggs are good breakfast cuisine.Come and follow me!"**

## step 1:

The main ingredients of bread are ready, low gluten flour can increase the softness, and all high gluten flour can also be used.

## step 2:

All ingredients except butter are put into the bread barrel.

## step 3:

Place the bread barrel in the Dongling 6D bread machine and start the kneading procedure for 20 minutes. When the dough is moist and can pull out the thick film, add butter, continue kneading, complete the remaining 5 minutes, and add another kneading procedure for 15 minutes.

## step 4:

The dough is soft and can pull out a transparent and elastic film. At the end of kneading, the dough is rounded and placed in a bread barrel. The fermentation process is started for 60 minutes, and a wet cloth is covered to prevent the dough skin from drying. The fermentation time is adjusted according to the dough state.

## step 5:

The dough is twice as big as the original dough. Dip your finger in the flour and punch a hole in the top. It won't collapse and shrink. The fermentation is successful.

Put the dough on the kneading mat, gently pat the exhaust gas, weigh and divide into 8 equal parts, knead round, relax for 10-15 minutes.

Roll down from the top, the interface naturally merges, and then rub it with your hands for a few times, forming an olive shape.

## step 9:

Put the shaping dough in the chef's 8-piece mold for secondary fermentation in a warm and humid place. I put it directly in the oven for natural fermentation.

## step 10:

When dough is nearly twice as old as before, a little white sesame is sprinkled on the surface of the egg brushing liquid, then the oven begins to preheat 180 degrees; after preheating, the surface mould is put into the middle of the oven, and the temperature and time are adjusted according to the actual situation of the oven.

# Tips

1. Without this kitchen model, it is not a problem to use other models, or to put them directly into small balls and bake them on a baking tray.2. The water absorption rate of flour is different, so the amount of water can be reserved for about 10 grams, and then decide whether to add water according to the dough state.3. The baking time and temperature are adjusted according to the material of the oven and the baking tray used and the size of dough.
