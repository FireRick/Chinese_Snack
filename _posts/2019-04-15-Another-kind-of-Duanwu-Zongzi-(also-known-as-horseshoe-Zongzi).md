# Introduction

**"Many people know about zongzi, mostly because the Dragon Boat Festival gift of the corner zongzi began, triangular zongzi and quadrangular zongzi.But few people know that dumplings (horseshoe dumplings) and horn dumplings are suitable for single people to eat, small and delicate.And zongzi is suitable for banquet use, because a zongzi is almost half a kilogram, and it is almost a dish when it is broken into small pieces.Corner dumplings are mostly stuffed dumplings, delicious dumplings and crystal dumplings, such as oil-sugar stuffed dumplings, bean paste stuffed dumplings, jujube wolfberry stuffed dumplings, rib-flavored dumplings, sago crystal dumplings and so on.Most of the dumplings are original flavor, but there are also red beans, mung beans, rice-flavored dumplings and so on (rice-flavored dumplings need certain technical skills and experience, because they are made of straw Platycodon as outsourcing materials, need bamboo tube assistance, there will be a recipe, with sweet dipping materials, brown sugar, sesame sugar, etc.).**

# Steps

## step 1:

The banana leaves are torn off along the middle thick Platycodon grandiflorum, and the fibers on a screw are kept on the leaf skin. Like folding fans, the leaves are folded into twenty or thirty centimeters long squares. The leaves are boiled in boiling water for about 10 to 20 minutes. Then they are put into containers, dried and cooled.(In my hometown of Chongqing, the most commonly used material for wrapping rice dumplings is banana leaves, because many people in my family have planted banana trees.It can also be used in bamboo leaves, boat leaves, ginger leaves, lotus leaves and so on.Boat leaves and ginger leaves are often used for Pao pig cakes. They are special features of Sichuan and Chongqing. They are interested in my understanding of recipes.)

## step 2:

Spread out the banana leaves, which are cooled by boiled water.

![step 2]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/2.jpg)

## step 3:

Remove leaves with a width of less than 20 cm at both ends. Cut and tear the fibers from the place where the fibers of Platycodon grandiflorum are retained. As a result, the direction of the rod fibers is shown below.

![step 3]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/3.jpg)

## step 4:

Start folding banana leaves to facilitate the quick wrapping of zongzi later. Fold them with fibers. Each fold is about five or six centimeters wide, as shown in the figure.

![step 4]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/4.jpg)

## step 5:

Fold four times in the same direction, which is equivalent to two and a half circles around the banana leaves. When the glutinous rice is opened, it becomes a cylindrical shape. The direction of the rod fibers should be horizontal, and the other side should be irregular.Fold four folds, cut the fibers along the side of the fold and tear them apart.

![step 5]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/5.jpg)

## step 6:

The effect is shown in the figure.

![step 6]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/6.jpg)

## step 7:

Turn the leaves without the direction of the rod fibers around five or six centimeters. The effect is shown in the figure.Several more outsourcing materials are discounted at one time.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/7.jpg)

## step 8:

The glutinous rice is filled from the holes in the square of the rod fibers.

![step 8]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/8.jpg)

## step 9:

Wash clean glutinous rice beforehand without soaking.(I washed it three times)

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Folded leaves of wrapped zongzi are filled with glutinous rice in a spoon with a diameter of five centimeters from the hole in the fiber side of the stem, and then filled flat.(Keep in mind that you can't press glutinous rice, knock on the whole body or shake it to tighten the settling of the glutinous rice. I'll explain the reason in the tips.)

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/10.jpg)

## step 11:

Sealing head, with a suitable size of leaves folded into two layers, folded width, at least twice the diameter of the sealed glutinous rice mouth, cover the mouth, with a thin cotton rope around two or three circles after tightening.Fasten the buckle so that it can be uncovered later.Without such a large leaf, use two overlapping sheets to form two layers.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/11.jpg)

## step 12:

Then turn it over, open the place that folded 45 centimeters before, and add a small amount of glutinous rice in, so that the horizontal plane of glutinous rice is about four centimeters from the caliber plane.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/12.jpg)

## step 13:

The head is also sealed. The extra four centimeters of leaves are directly pressed and folded down. The leaves are tied in two or three loops with a thin cotton rope.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/13.jpg)

## step 14:

Then the zongzi body oblique direction, at intervals of one or two centimeters, wrap the cotton rope tightly, and tie it with the cotton rope at the baotou.The rope around you should not be too tight, just use a little force.Put it in a large pot of boiled water. The water is less than five centimeters long. Cover and boil for one hour.

![step 14]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/14.jpg)

## step 15:

After boiling for an hour, turn over the dumplings and turn the top layer to the bottom.Cover and cook for about an hour.On the first day, zongzi is directly stored in the water of boiling zongzi, which is a method of water sealing and air isolation.

![step 15]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/15.jpg)

## step 16:

Take it out when you eat. If you can finish it in a few days, soak it in fresh water every other day. It can be kept fresh by water sealing method for up to five to seven days.(It can also be stored in refrigerators, but every time you eat it, you need to heat it thoroughly and cool it to room temperature, because when you eat it in refrigerators, even in the insurance layer, the glutinous rice will harden and dehydrate slightly because of the low temperature, making the taste worse.The water-sealed preservation method overcomes this shortcoming and can be directly taken out for food, still moist.However, water should be changed every day (24 hours). The longest preservation period should not exceed seven days. The temperature should exceed 30 degrees in overheated weather. Water should be changed once in 12 hours. The preservation period should not exceed four days.)

![step 16]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/16.jpg)

## step 17:

The basic standard of each dumpling is about 20 centimeters long, and one dumpling weighs nearly half a kilogram. Therefore, every time you eat it, you can get the quantity of a dish by taking one.

![step 17]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/17.jpg)

## step 18:

Untie the cotton rope, tear off the wrapped leaves and prepare a plate.

![step 18]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/18.jpg)

## step 19:

Because the glutinous dumplings are soft and sticky, they can not be cut by knife decomposition method and are easy to stick knives, so they use a special strand cutting method. This method is very simple, but many people do not know it.Choose short lines at both ends of wrapped zongzi, almost half a meter long or so, and choose one.

![step 19]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/19.jpg)

## step 20:

Use your teeth to bite one end of the line and twist your fingers around five centimeters on the other end of the line to make it easier to pinch the line.

![step 20]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/20.jpg)

## step 21:

Take zongzi in your left hand and thread in your right hand and make a circle from half to one centimeter away from the beginning of zongzi.

![step 21]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/21.jpg)

## step 22:

Pull your right hand out and cut the Zong slices.

![step 22]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/22.jpg)

## step 23:

Every half centimeter to about one centimeter, the same circle of twisting method is used to cut the Zong slices and get a plate of processed Zong zi.I like the thickness of half a centimeter according to my taste.)

![step 23]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/23.jpg)

## step 24:

Now we begin to make stuffing. My family likes sweet rice dumplings, so we choose the commonly used linseed candy dipping material.Sesame oil can be squeezed, so white sesame is also called oil sesame.Fried sesame seeds can be used for many times, and can be used for many times. It can also be used for stuffing stuffed bun and other pasta. For example, I have oil and sugar filling in Sichuan and Chongqing characteristic pork noodles and my sugar pancakes.I fried 10 cm diameter spoonful of white sesame this time.

![step 24]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/24.jpg)

## step 25:

Stir-fry over medium and small heat until pale yellow and white and golden.

![step 25]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/25.jpg)

## step 26:

Some cooked sesame seeds are put into gauze of suitable size.

![step 26]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/26.jpg)

## step 27:

Put away the bags around you and hold them together.

![step 27]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/27.jpg)

## step 28:

The ripe sesame seeds can be crushed by beating or rolling with thicker glass bottles, or by hammer, or by putting a dressing machine or garlic garlic garlic garlic garlic garlic garlic garlic garlic garlic.The instant aroma soared.

![step 28]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/28.jpg)

## step 29:

It can be crushed to about 80 percent.

![step 29]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/29.jpg)

## step 30:

In a suitable size bowl, white granulated sugar: cooked sesame shredded in a ratio of 8:1.

![step 30]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/30.jpg)

## step 31:

Use chopsticks to mix well, that is dipping material.

![step 31]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/31.jpg)

## step 32:

Zongzi can be eaten with dipping material.Soft waxy and sweet, the taste is compact, soft and waxy.It can also be eaten without dipping.

![step 32]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/32.jpg)

## step 33:

My family also wrapped triangle dumplings, which are filled with oil and sugar and flavored with Chinese jujube and wolfberry.Because our family eats glutinous rice very sweet, so several kinds of bags are sweet and fragrant.If you want to know how to make oil and sugar stuffing, you can refer to my oil and sugar stuffing in the Sichuan and Chongqing characteristic pig cakes, or refer to the cookies, oil and sugar pancakes that I will send later.

![step 33]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403524/33.jpg)

## step 34:

The size of the triangle dumplings is enough for a person to eat.Suitable for gifts, not for banquets, banquets need to understand a few, trouble, no Zong for banquets convenient, but not for a person to eat, may not finish.

# Tips

1. Retain part of the stem fibers at the end of the ripped banana leaves, so that the banana leaves do not crack easily.2. Boil the banana leaves and soften them, so that they do not crack easily when they are used.3. Banana leaves fold four folds, which are quite two and a half circles around. When boiled glutinous rice expands, the skin is not easily broken.4. When the banana leaves are folded along the fibers, they should be aligned to make it easier for the head to be wrapped separately with the leaves, while the other end is not aligned because the head directly depresses the sealing of its own leaves.5. When glutinous rice is added, it can not be pressed and tapped to settle down and tighten, and the cotton rope wrapped around the body can not be wrapped too tightly, because the glutinous rice will expand after cooking, too tight glutinous rice can not expand well, there will be cooked but hard rice heart in the center, which will affect the taste, and also increase the cooking time.6. It will be healthier and safer to wrap zongzi with cotton thread and plant filament. Don't lazy with plastic thread.7. It takes about two hours to boil the strip dumplings, because dumplings not only need to be boiled, but also to be soft and waxy.Turn over the dumplings halfway to make them more uniform and thorough.8. Cook well and keep in the refrigerator, but every time you eat it, you need to heat it, because when you keep it in the refrigerator, the glutinous rice will harden and dehydrate slightly due to the low temperature, which will make the taste worse.The water-sealed preservation method overcomes this shortcoming and can be directly taken out for food.However, water should be changed every day (24 hours). The longest preservation period should not exceed seven days. The temperature should exceed 30 degrees in overheated weather. Water should be changed once in 12 hours. The preservation period should not exceed four days.9. Zongzi is decomposed into small pieces. It is not suitable to use knife to cut and stick knife.So the wire stranding method is used.10. Oil sesame sugar dipping material, sesame proportion can not be too high, too strong aroma, easy to greasy taste.
