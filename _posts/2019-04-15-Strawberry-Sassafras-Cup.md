# Introduction

**"Soft cakes and mellow butter are fascinating, especially when it's cold, these beautiful delicacies are always appearing in front of us.I made two cakes the day before. In order to look good, I cut off the head of the top-falling cake, and left the light cream with the decorative cookie stick.Although it's easy to put it directly into my mouth, I don't want to waste these materials, so I took the initiative to make two "wooden Hibiscus cups" out of these edges and corners.The origin of the name can be guessed from the picture by 89 points.Cake crumbs are very similar in color to wood crumbs, hence the name.The cascade of wooden Hibiscus cups looks very beautiful, coupled with chocolate chips and strawberries, have a sense of standing out."**
