# Tips

1. The ratio of mango puree to milk can be adjusted appropriately. If there is no ice water, use cold water as much as possible. When milk is boiled, let sugar melt and turn off the fire. When it is aired, add the gelatin. The ratio of gelatin to the melt is basically 1:40, that is, 1 piece of 5 grams of gelatin can be mixed into 200 grams of liquid. 2. Mango can also be changed into other kinds of liquids.Fruit; If you are not afraid of trouble, you can also make a variety of color stratification; until each layer solidifies, then pour into the new mango melt; after refrigeration, take out as soon as possible to eat, to prevent heating and softening and affect the taste.
