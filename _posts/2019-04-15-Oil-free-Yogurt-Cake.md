# Steps

## step 1:

Prepare regular flour instead of high-gluten flour.

## step 6:

Add five scoops of flour and stir the spoon equally. The batter should be thick enough to be picked up with a spoon and flowed intermittently. It is too thin to be soldered.

Add a spoonful of sugar and mix well.

## step 10:

The cake pan is opened and preheated in a column. Pour the paste into the cake pan with a spoon. It can be branded four times at a time. Do not put oil in the cake pan.

## step 11:

It can also be branded in the mould, but it always feels bad and sticks, so it does not use the mould.

## step 12:

The good side is branded by turning the other side for a moment.

## step 13:

The delicious butterless yogurt cake is ready. Make it a snack for the baby.

# Tips

Keep in mind that the batter must be still for half an hour before branding, so that the baking powder fully infiltrated into the batter.
