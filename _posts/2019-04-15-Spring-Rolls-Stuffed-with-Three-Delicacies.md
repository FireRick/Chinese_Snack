## step 3:

The loose dough rolls out the roll book and then uses the dumpling mould to press out the skin.

## step 4:

The rolled surface is brushed with thin oil and folded together. The last surface is not brushed with oil. Just fold eight to ten sheets at a time.

## step 5:

Put the oil-brushed dumpling skin into the fresh-keeping bag and roll it thin.

# Tips

1. Because the amount of water absorbed by flour is different, the amount of water used may also be different, so add 2. I used a fresh-keeping film to put the dumpling skin folded together into the bag. I rolled the dough skin with a rolling stick, rolled the large and thin silk, rolled the small and thick. This can be operated according to personal preference (the advantage of using the fresh-keeping film bag is that after rolling, the fresh-keeping bag will be thrown directly without pressing the board and the thin silk).The rolling pins are oily.)
