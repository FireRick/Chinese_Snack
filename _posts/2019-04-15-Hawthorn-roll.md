# Steps

## step 1:

Prepare yellow ice sugar and fresh hawthorn.

## step 2:

Hawthorn denucleation method: Hawthorn lateral twist, divided into half with nucleus, the other half without nucleus.

## step 3:

Get rid of the aggregated cores, and in this way you don't have to cut them one by one.

## step 4:

The lower half of the pedicled part of the pulp is broken into several pieces, leaving the complete pedicle to be discarded.

## step 5:

All hawthorns are treated in this way.

## step 6:

Put the Hawthorn in a small pot, add water to cover the hawthorn, then put it into the sweet juice garden yellow ice sugar.It can also be replaced by sweet juice garden sugar (white) or fine granulated sugar.The sweetness of iced sugar is lower than that of fine granulated sugar, so the amount of iced sugar should be adjusted as appropriate.

## step 7:

After boiling over high heat, bake for about ten minutes until hawthorn is soft and rotten.

## step 8:

Boil the soft hawthorn out.Hawthorn ice-sugar water left in the pot can be refrigerated in the refrigerator, drink a little daily, and also help digestion.

## step 9:

Hawthorn and some ice sugar water are put into the cooking machine or wall breaker to make mud.

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427056/9.jpg)

## step 10:

In a non-stick frying pan, the Hawthorn mud is stir-fried to a sticky consistency with a small fire, so that it will not drip on the spade. In this way, the first frying can shorten the drying time.

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427056/10.jpg)

## step 11:

Hawthorn mud is poured into a gold plate (a square non-stick baking plate with a side length of 28cm) and smoothed with a scraper.The baking tray can be brushed with a little vegetable oil in advance, or covered with oil paper, which is more convenient for demoulding.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427056/11.jpg)

## step 12:

Put in the middle and lower layers of the preheated oven, and heat up and down 150 degrees, and bake in hot air for about 1 hour.If you don't have an oven, or are not in a hurry to eat, you can hang the pan in a cool, ventilated place for two or three days.The thinner the scrape, the easier it will dry.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427056/12.jpg)

## step 13:

Remove the semi-dried Hawthorn slices from the oven, turn them over after demoulding, and put them on oilpaper to cool.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427056/13.jpg)

## step 14:

Cut off the hard part of the corner with a knife and divide the whole piece into several pieces.

![step 14]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427056/14.jpg)

## step 15:

Cut it into two finger wide strips and roll it up from one end.

# Tips

1. The degree of drying should be noted, if you want to eat hawthorn rolls, half-dried rolls are better, and will not crack.If you want to make a stronger mouthfeel, you can divide the puree into two pieces and pour them into gold plates, each time scraping into 2 mm thick slices, drying more thoroughly.2. No additives were used in the whole process. Coloring is the natural pigment of hawthorn. Sweetness is the flavor of old ice sugar. Forming viscosity is the natural gum of hawthorn pulp.Sealed refrigeration can be kept for about half a month.3. Polycrystalline ice sugar, also known as old ice sugar, is a product of dissolution, impurity removal, juice clearance, evaporation, concentration and crystallization.According to the production process, boiling time and decolorization process, the old sugar has white, yellow, light grey and so on.Old ice sugar has lower sweetness than white granulated sugar, and it has the function of relieving cough and resolving phlegm and moistening lung. It is suitable for eating in autumn and winter.4. The amount of old ice sugar can be adjusted according to the acidity of hawthorn.When the Hawthorn paste is fried well, if the sweetness is not enough, you can add a small amount of sweet garden sugar one by one, and continue to fry in the pot until it melts into the fruit paste.
