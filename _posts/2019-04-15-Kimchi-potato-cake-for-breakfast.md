# Introduction

**"This is a breakfast cake that my family and I love very much. We use two large potatoes to make it every time, otherwise we can't eat enough.Daughter also likes it. Although there is spicy cabbage in it, it tastes crisp, a little sweet and spicy is very appetizing, and children who do not eat spicy food can eat it.Potatoes are soft, sticky and not sticky. They are very tasty to match. Make sure you cook them once and want to eat them next time.Because it's breakfast, so the materials and methods are not complicated. It can be done in ten minutes.Let's take a look next.**

# Steps

## step 1:

Prepare all kinds of materials.Hot cabbage is Korean kimchi. A spoonful of kimchi soup tastes better.Cut onions into thin shreds, wash and scrape potatoes.

## step 2:

Rub the potatoes into slightly thick shreds. Cut the hot cabbage into thin shreds. Mix well with onion shreds and pickle soup.

## step 3:

Add 1 tablespoon of flour and mix well, then use common flour such as dumpling flour.

## step 4:

Add in the beaten eggs and mix with a little salt, as shown in the picture.Don't put too much flour and eggs all at once. It will make the cake too solid and the taste too dead.

## step 5:

Add a little vegetable oil to the bottom of the non-stick pan, heat it and put a circular metal mould in.If you don't care about the good shape, you can do without the mold. Except the edges are not very uniform, nothing else will affect it.This is the three-inch mold I used to make Musk Cake, or it's replaced by an open can cut at both ends.Clamp two chopsticks and put the shredded potatoes into the mould. The top of the shredded potatoes is slightly flattened and heated over low heat.

## step 6:

If the bottom is solidified like the picture, turn the mould over completely and let the unheated side face down.

## step 7:

Make a circle along the edge with a knife so that the cake falls into the pot and is heated over a small fire for a while until the bottom is solidified.

## step 8:

Take the mould off the cake and repeat the steps just taken to make the next cake.If you don't use moulds, or have several moulds, you can make several at the same time.

## step 9:

Well done, eat while it's hot.
