## step 3:

Add appropriate amount of oil to the pot and heat it, add chopsticks into the oil to bubbles, and then fry the river shrimp. When the sticking together is loosened with chopsticks, the river shrimp can be out of the pot by bending golden yellow. Because it is small river shrimp, it can be fried crispy in three minutes without re-frying.Attention should be paid to the medium-fire frying, not small-fire, too slow will absorb oil, shrimp eat very oily.
