# Tips

1. Chestnuts can be roasted for several more minutes if they want to have more fragrance. 2. Care must be taken for hand safety when opening the incision. 3. The best way to roast chestnuts is to choose smaller chestnuts, which are too big to roast thoroughly, and which are not easy to burst. 4. When roasting, it is necessary to move chestnuts from time to time to prevent uneven coloring.
