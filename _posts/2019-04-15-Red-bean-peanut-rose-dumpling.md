# Introduction

**"Zongzi season is in front of us. In the past years, we were always too lazy to make zongzi, because we always had to receive a lot of dumplings, but we couldn't eat them.This year, before the Zongzi Festival arrived, the idea of wrapping zongzi was aroused, because a lot of rose sauce suddenly triggered the idea of rosy zongzi.The first thing that flashed into my mind was Babao Rose Dumpling. However, before I could think of all the Babao ingredients, I decided to give up. Because the total amount was too small, the allocation of the Babao ingredients was even less, which could be neglected.Instead, take one or two of them and make a red bean, peanut and rose dumpling.Remove all the ripe leaves and wrap them in small rose dumplings.Zongye is too small, Zongzi is much smaller than before, it's totally super mini.Immediately after cooking, find out the smallest one and eat it, and then remember to look at the smallest one.So find out the smallest one left and weigh it. It's only 12 grams!Isn't that the one you just ate 10 grams at most?Eat four at a time!It's the strongest in history, and the four are less than 60 grams. It sounds like it's not as much as a dumpling in the street.**

# Tips

Too many rose petals will affect the taste of zongzi, which can be reduced in this amount, but it is not recommended to increase.The cooking time should be increased or decreased according to the size of zongzi.When eating, dip in sugar/brown sugar/honey according to your taste.
