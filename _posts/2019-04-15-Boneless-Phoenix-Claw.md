# Tips

Because there is no time to cook carefully, so many dishes are made with pressure cookers.Families like to eat spicy food, so often do spicy dishes, do not like spicy relatives, can do the same way, but do not put Pixian bean paste and spicy saucepan seasoning, instead of bean paste and sweet sauce, and then out of the frying pan to collect juice, as delicious.
