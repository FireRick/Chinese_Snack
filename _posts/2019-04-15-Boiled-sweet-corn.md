# Introduction

**"Corn is not only a common food, but also a health food recommended by experts. There are many cooking methods.I like to cook tender corn with several layers of husk and corn silk. It not only has the fragrance of corn, but also retains the original flavor of food to the greatest extent. It is simple, convenient and nutritious.**
