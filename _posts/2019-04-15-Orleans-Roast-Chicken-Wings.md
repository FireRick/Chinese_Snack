# Introduction

**"When I was young, I especially liked eating chicken wings. How could I spend less time with my husband watching football matches with my favorite roast chicken wings? In the middle of the night, the earliest wave of roast chicken wings in Orleans was in KFC N years ago, but in recent years, I bought some materials to make them at home, so I made them for convenience."**
