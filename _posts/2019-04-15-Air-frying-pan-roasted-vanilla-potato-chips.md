# Tips

First, butter can also be put into the microwave oven for 10-12 seconds to dissolve butter and then mix it in potatoes; second, it is difficult to give an accurate number of baking time, because the size of potato chips directly affects the length of baking time, do not start baking at too high temperature, when the surface is too hot, the inside is scorched, so it is more reasonable to bake at medium temperature before baking at high temperature.
