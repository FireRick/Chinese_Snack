# Introduction

**"A lot of people don't like potatoes and worry about getting fat when they eat them!In fact, the appearance of potatoes is not impressive, the growth of local atmosphere, the name is also with a potato word; but now potatoes are known as the highest nutrition, the lowest calorie vegetables, not to mention that 90% of potatoes belong to starch, but that is resistant starch has the role of reducing adipocytes, eating potatoes can increase satiety, and contains nutrients to protect gastric mucosa, help digestion.It also improves immunity, so eating potatoes won't make you fat, but you'll be slim.Make a snack with potatoes that adults and children love to eat. Originally, this dish should be made with bread bran. But I think the bread bran is too greasy, so I replaced it with cornflakes. But the fact proves that it tastes more crisp with cornflakes. It's crisp outside and soft inside. That's called a fragrance.**
