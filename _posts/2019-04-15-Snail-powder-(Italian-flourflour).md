# Tips

After all, pasta is not rice noodles and tastes similar, but there must be differences in taste. The one in my family likes it better and eats two meals in succession. We can add or subtract dishes according to the materials in our family, but sour bamboo shoots, sour beans and spiral powder soup are indispensable. Otherwise, it will become Italian soup noodles.I wish you all good health and weight loss.
