# Tips

1. Cook the shrimp and green beans first and peel the shrimp.I didn't take pictures here, so this step was omitted.2. Fire Hou must be well mastered: beat eggs into the pot before firing, first medium and small fires, egg white slightly solidified immediately changed to light fires.Keep in mind that the fire should not be too big, lest the top is not ripe and the bottom is muddy.3. It's better to cover it. The top is ripe faster.4. Sprinkle black pepper when it is not solidified.
