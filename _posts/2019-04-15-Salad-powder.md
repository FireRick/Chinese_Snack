# Introduction

**"It seems that this delicious dish of salad powder exists in many areas. I have traveled to Jiangxi and tasted it in the group meal arranged by the tour guide.In Guilin, Guangxi, when I entered the restaurant in the morning, I saw two plates of cold powder with different flavors on the table.After buying rice flour, I made the sauce by the taste of the salad powder I had tasted. Although it was not authentic, it benefited from the tendons of the rice flour itself, and cooked with water to cool, which made the rice flour neither soft nor sticky.Flexible rice flour, mixed with sauce, appetizing and refreshing.**
