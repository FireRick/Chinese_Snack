# Steps

## step 1:

Don't rush to make sweet potatoes when you buy them. Put them in a cool and dry place for a week or so to make them sweeter.It is necessary to turn over the sweet potatoes in order to prevent the rotting and deterioration of the sweet potatoes touching the ground for a long time.Do not put sweet potatoes in plastic bags.The best way is to lay a layer of newspaper or kitchen paper.The best time to make sweet potatoes is when the surface of the potatoes is wilting.Wash, peel and slice sweet potatoes.The thickness of the tablet is 0.5 cm.Then steamed for 6 to 8 minutes.

# Tips

This method differs from the traditional method in that it is fast.The time of steaming and drying was shortened.There's another way to change it. It's suitable for friends in the north. Steam it before going to bed at night and put it on the heater. You can eat it the next morning.If you put the heater on, you need to slice the sweet potato slices thicker, otherwise they will dry too fast and be easy to bite.Sweet potato chips must not be steamed too ripe, too ripe will be broken.When a piece of water about 5 mm is boiled, 6 to 8 minutes is enough.
