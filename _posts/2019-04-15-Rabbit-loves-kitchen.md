# Tips

1. Rinse chicken feet with cold boiled water after they are cooked, so that chicken feet can be cooled quickly, while avoiding the residual soup easy to freeze; 2. When popping garlic, the oil temperature should not be overheated, and it is suggested to use small fire.Otherwise, garlic will be bitter.
