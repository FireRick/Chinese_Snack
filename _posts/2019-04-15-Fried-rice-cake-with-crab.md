# Introduction

**"Now it's time to eat crabs. Coke spoiled me. I went to another place to do business the day before yesterday. It was a long way to go to that vegetable market. But I drove to the refrigerator full of crabs and rice cakes to eat greedily. When I bought crabs and rice cakes, I went out to fetch something and came back, I heard a crackle. It was all over the place, and my arms were scalded, but the taste of crabs was too good.It's worth it!"**

## step 2:

Now we're going to clean up the crabs. See, this one is going to be removed from the stomach.

## step 3:

Then use your hand to pull off the lid on your back, which may be a little cruel. If you buy a live crab that feels too tied with your hand, use chopsticks to operate it. See if the cheek is gone. Ooh, clean it.

## step 9:

Friendship reminds us that when the rice cake is hollow, it will explode. Oh, I am the victim. I go out and get something and come back and I hear a crack. I want to turn off the fire and fry all the oil on my body. There are many hot marks on my arms. Just fry a little.
