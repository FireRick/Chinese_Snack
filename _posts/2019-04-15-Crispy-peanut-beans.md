# Tips

1. If you like spicy food, you can put some chilli powder in the mixing seasoning, which is more or less added according to your own preferences, because I have children in my family, but not chilli powder.2. Friends without oven don't worry. Peanuts mixed with corn starch and seasoning are fried in a frying pan to make them more delicious. I am too lazy to open fire, so I think of this lazy way. No cook wants to stay in the kitchen in summer. It's really hot and dark.
