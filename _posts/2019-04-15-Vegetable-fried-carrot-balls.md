# Tips

1. The whole egg or the egg white can be used when mixing the pellets. The taste is slightly different and the effect is not significant.2. When starch is added, it should be added slowly to reach the consistency. If the amount of food is large, the amount of eggs or egg white can be increased to the consistency.3. When the remaining oil is used to stir-fry again, because it is already cooked oil, hot oil can stir-fry in a frying pan to avoid repeated high temperature.
