# Tips

Because shepherd's purse eats oil, the minced meat selected for stewing should be fatter to ensure the taste. If the minced meat selected is thinner (the minced meat I put in is thinner), proper amount of oil (according to personal preference) should be put in. Remember to put oil (lock water) first, then salt, so as not to release salt and then soak the water of shepherd's purse.
