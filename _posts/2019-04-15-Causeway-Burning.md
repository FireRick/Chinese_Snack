# Tips

/ How to fry the burnt color of the cookie/crust evenly?The pan is first preheated over medium heat and then cooled on a wet towel.Then turn the stove into a small fire, put the pot on and pour in the batter.You need to be patient and slow frying. Don't fry too many crusts at a time. Otherwise, the temperature of the pot will drop and the color will be uneven./ After air-cooling/cookie crust is fried, it is better to put a fresh-keeping film on the surface. If the moisture is lost too much, the cookie crust will taste a little dry./ Red Bean Stuffing/Detailed Pictures and Texts please refer to the previous Picture and Text recipe "Egg Yolk Crisp" period./ Taste/formula is the cake skin of tea-smelling taste. If you want to make the original flavor, you can directly change the amount of tea-smearing powder into low-gluten flour.
