# Introduction

**"There's been a lot of making cake bread with pineapple pits, but no cake.Suddenly aware of this, suddenly a flash of light.How about a muffin?No flour, only pineapple nut beaten flour.Because this can maximize the consumption of pineapple kernels.The powder made from pineapple honey stone has no gluten. Will the pancakes shrink after cooling?That's all we have to wait and see.The moist pineapple kernel powder itself carries a lot of moisture, and will not absorb too much milk.So the amount of milk needs to be carefully measured.Put it in the last step to adjust the consistency of the batter.In this way, it is not possible to make the batter too thin at once and then make up for it in a hurry.Look, that seems to be a good rise. There is no recycling.Soft is soft, but the taste is slightly rough, less delicate than flour.It's sweet, but it doesn't make people think about jackfruit....**

# Tips

Pineapple nut powder is a kind of powder which is made by steaming and shelling the pineapple nut.Do not like whole pineapple kernel powder can be replaced by some flour.Milk dosage should be increased or decreased according to the moisture content of pineapple kernels, and added separately, so that the paste can reach the ideal state.Electric cakes can be replaced by pans.
