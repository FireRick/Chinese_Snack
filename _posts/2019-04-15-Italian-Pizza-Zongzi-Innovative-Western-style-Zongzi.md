# Tips

1. Tomato paste can be replaced by ketchup if it is troublesome, but the dosage should be paid attention to in order to prevent the product from overacidity.2. Meat filling should be marinated for at least 2 hours, not more than 1 night at most. If the water comes out, stir again until all the water is inhaled by the meat filling, then it can be wrapped.3. Cheese can choose any kind of cheese you like, because the boiling temperature of zongzi is not enough, so there can be no cheese heartwood, not without mozzarella cheese.4. In the case of glutinous rice, it is recommended to soak for at least 2 hours, up to 8 hours.5. Step 8 is mainly aimed at beginners. Although it is troublesome to do so, the success rate is high. 6. For the beauty of the finished products, it is suggested that the dumplings should be folded only once, so that the redundant parts can be cut off.7. When putting rice dumplings, remember to adjust the position slightly to ensure that they are all in the same height and can all submerge in the water.8. If the rice dumplings float in the water, it is suggested to press a plate on the rice dumplings so as to heat evenly when cooking.
