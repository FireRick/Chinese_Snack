# Steps

## step 1:

Raw melon seeds are put in the oven, 160 degrees circulating fire, the middle and lower layers are baked for 30 minutes, then shake the baking pan every other time (I bake a kilogram, so the baking time is long, if the baking minutes are less).

## step 6:

When you boil this ginger syrup, you can dip a drop of syrup with a chopstick, put it in cold water and instantly shape it, and then bite it to be crisp.

## step 8:

Then put the melon seed sugar on the oil paper and cover it with a layer of oil paper. Roll the melon seed sugar flat with a rolling pin. Roll it as thin as possible. Cut it into small pieces with a knife immediately after rolling. Don't wait until it's cold to cut it again! ____________If it's cold, it'll cut into a lot of crumbs.

# Tips

1: When roasting melon seeds, if you roast a catty of melon seeds, you can roast them for 30 minutes. If you roast less, you can roast them for about 10 minutes to 20 minutes. 2. If you don't have an oven, you can cook them in a frying pan.
