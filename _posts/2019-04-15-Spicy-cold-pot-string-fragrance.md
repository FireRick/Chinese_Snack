# Tips

1. Pork chooses plum stick meat and beef chooses tender tender tender meat.2. Cut meat into rectangular strips.Grab the marinated meat and meat evenly and marinate for more than 2 hours. I usually put it in the refrigerator for one night.3. Bone soup tastes better at the bottom of the soup.
