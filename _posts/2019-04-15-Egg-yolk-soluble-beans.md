# Introduction

**"Babies can add yolk after 6 months, but there are always some little guys who are very exclusive to yolk. There are many babies who only eat egg white but not yolk. Generally speaking, babies usually have a special preference for good taste food, like yolk, we adults are choking, let alone children.At this time, we might as well take egg yolk as the main ingredient and make it into instant egg yolk dissolved beans, which not only solves the baby's trouble of not eating egg yolk, but also exercises the flexibility of the baby's fingers, and can't stop eating one.**
