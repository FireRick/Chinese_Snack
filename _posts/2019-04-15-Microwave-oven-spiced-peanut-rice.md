# Steps

## step 1:

Rinse the raw peanuts with water and drain the water.

## step 2:

All seasonings are poured into a bowl or container that can be heated in a microwave oven.

## step 3:

Mix the seasoning evenly, add a large glass of water, cover the lid (the lid should have air permeability holes, or just like me, use a loosely sealed lid). Put it in the microwave oven and heat it for 2 minutes on high heat.

## step 4:

Remove the heated condiment box from the microwave oven, open the lid, and pour the raw peanut rice into it (warm hands carefully), so that the liquid surface has just soaked the peanut rice.

## step 8:

Remove from the microwave oven, turn the peanuts over with a spoon, then put them in the microwave oven, high heat for three minutes.At this time, you will hear the tiny sound of "cracking" bursting in the microwave oven, which is the sound of the skin bursting. It is almost the same if you have this sound.

## step 9:

Finally, turn the peanuts over again, heat them for 30 seconds with high heat, take them out to cool a little, rub them with your hands, and the red dress falls off as thin and crisp as in the picture, so it's ready.Is it very simple?Let's give it a try.

# Tips

Because the power of the microwave oven is different, it is necessary to adjust the time according to different microwave ovens, heating in stages, not to scorch all at once, so it is impossible to eat.
