# Introduction

**"Perhaps the most popular food around the Qingming Dynasty is the Youth League, which is a snack in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but now it is popular all over China, presumably it is inseparable from the development of the network.I used to work as a youth league, but I couldn't find a spinach juice to replace mugwort.It looks the same, but it tastes so bad.Spinach is usually delicious when it is served at ordinary times, but when it is steamed in glutinous rice flour, it has a strange smell, and I have never done it after being tucking out by my family.Fortunately, there is a very convenient online shopping, although 25 yuan 2 kg of mugwort is not cheap, but I am still enthusiastic to do the Youth League.The first meal of the spring green bamboo shoots * dried pork stuffed with pork is very soft, and the salty stuffing is still very much like the stuffed stuffed stuffed buns.So busily I made this net red salted egg yolk pork Silk Green ball, but it tasted better. Cold and hot meals have different flavors. The meat floss has the strong fragrance of salted egg yolk. It really eats two confusing meals.**

## step 3:

Artemisia argyi is cut into small sections and put into a broken wall cooking machine, and then pour 400 grams of cold water into the pulp. The amount of water can be adjusted according to the amount of green leagues to be done. The amount of water is more, the color of green leagues is heavier, the amount of water is less, and the color of green leagues is lighter.

## step 8:

Weighing the glutinous rice dough into 45 grams each, I used the extra dough to wrap the stuffing of spring bamboo shoots and dried beans left in the morning.If you want to clean all the glutinous rice dough, you can divide it into 13 parts on average, but the skin is slightly thicker.

## step 14:

After steaming, a thin layer of vegetable oil is brushed on the surface to prevent the skin from evaporating, drying and cracking, and at the same time to prevent sticky hands.Hot or cold food can be eaten, there will be different flavors.

1. Moxa can remove excess oxalic acid after boiling water. An endless pulp can be stored in the refrigerator. It is more delicate with straw juice and flour, and the color of straw pulp and flour is darker. 2. Egg yolk can be kneaded together with meat pine after ripening, and it can also remove the fishy smell. The amount of meat pine can be adjusted as you like, and can be kneaded into a ball. 3. It can also be wrapped with glutinous rice flour without wheat starch.Will be more soft waxy; 4. homemade meat pine: pig lean meat Shun silk cut large pieces, cooked and torn into thin silk, into bread machine, add soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, sugar juice, fry to the velvet, cool after storage.
