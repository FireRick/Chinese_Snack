# Tips

The first frying is not easy to fry for a long time, but can be cooked in seventy or eighty minutes. The second frying should be fast and the diced meat should be evenly fried.The stir-frying fire must be small, but the doubtful fire can be separated from the stir-frying fire. Stir-fry slowly but not incense.Hot and spicy meat can be stir-fried with shallow cooking wine when diced meat is served.
