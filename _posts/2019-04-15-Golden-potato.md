# Tips

1. When wiping, the container is filled with clear water, and the wiped potato shreds remain colourless in the water.2. The oil temperature should not be high when the potato shreds are put in, so as to prevent the water of the potato shreds from splashing the oil.3. Because the shredded potatoes are very thin, the heat should be mastered when frying, otherwise they will be easily pasted.4. Because meat floss is salty, no additional salt is needed.5. The oil in the pot should not be less, otherwise the potatoes will easily form a ball.The movement is light and fragile after separation.
