## step 5:

Pour in most bowls of mushroom water and stifle it with a small fire. Is this really different? If you put mushroom water in the pot, it will be very delicious. There is soup in the pot. Don't be afraid, it will be absorbed after putting in glutinous rice, but if you like soft soup juice, you can have more, and if you like hard soup, the opposite is true.~
