## step 4:

Hot oil in oil pan, put pepper and salt in the same time. Healthy eating method should be to sprinkle pepper and salt on it directly after the pot is out. I am lazy, so I go into the pot together. Besides, I don't need to fry the oil at too high temperature. I know that high-protein food, protein and high-temperature oil combine to produce harmful substances of `heterocyclic amine'and `benzopyrene and fry them slowly at high temperature.
