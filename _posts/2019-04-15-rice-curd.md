# Introduction

**"Maybe it's the nature of eating food. I like to study snacks everywhere. Most of the snacks in the north are made of flour. Since I came to Wuhan, the most I have touched is rice. I have fallen in love with all kinds of food made of rice. Although I grew up with noodles, I don't feel that I don't like noodles very much. Anyway, I like noodles made of rice.Following my husband back home, they will make gray water dumplings there for the Spring Festival, a large piece. The finished products are sliced and fried with a light yellow color after cooling. After that, I came back to check a lot of information. Sichuan and Guizhou are called rice tofu, which is also called gray water dumpling. One side is very suitable for family to make rice tofu. When the rice tofu is warm, I eat soft glutinous Q-bullet, and slice oil after cooling.Fried or fried bacon is very delicious!"**
