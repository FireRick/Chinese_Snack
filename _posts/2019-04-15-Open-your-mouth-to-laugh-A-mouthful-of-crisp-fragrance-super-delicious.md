# Steps

## step 1:

Firstly, the flour is mixed with 50g corn oil, which can destroy its gluten structure, so the fried product will be especially crisp.

## step 2:

Mix the scraper slightly, then rub the upper hand slightly, let the oil and flour mix, like me, rub into this sandy state, do not have to bother Bara rubbing very evenly.~

## step 3:

Then add 55g sugar, 2G salt, 1g baking soda, 1g baking powder, and mix them evenly with a scraper. When baking powder is heated, it will produce gas quickly and make the mouth laugh. And baking soda can make the dough slightly yellow and appetite more.

## step 4:

Beat an egg in, add 85 ml of milk, mix with flour slightly, and let the flour absorb the liquid.

![step 4]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/4.jpg)

## step 5:

Then you can directly start, knead into a more soft and wet dough, you can not see the dry powder, you can see the state of the dough, if too dry, you can add a little water or milk.

![step 5]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/5.jpg)

## step 6:

Cover the dough with a fresh-keeping film and let it relax for 15 minutes.

![step 6]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/6.jpg)

## step 7:

Take out the loose dough and knead it into a long strip just like making dumplings.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/7.jpg)

## step 8:

With the scraper cut into a uniform small dough, I can divide the amount of about 20, and then knead into small round dough.

![step 8]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/8.jpg)

## step 9:

Add a small amount of flour in the clear water, mix well, and put the dough just kneaded into the water to soak it. In this way, the dough will stick to sesame more easily.

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Drain the water a little and roll it in the ready sesame. You can also rub it gently with your hands to make the sesame stick more firmly.

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/10.jpg)

## step 11:

When you are ready, you can turn on the oil hot pot. When the oil temperature is heated to the chopsticks, some small bubbles begin to pop up quickly. It's about 150 degrees so that you can turn off the fire and let the small sesame pellets come down.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/11.jpg)

## step 12:

When the pot was just down, the sesame ball sank and there was no big movement. There was no need to rush for a while to start bubbling.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/12.jpg)

## step 13:

After a minute or so, it was obvious that the dough began to float up slowly, which indicated that the inside of the dough began to expand.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/13.jpg)

## step 14:

At this time, we will open a small fire to heat, help the dough continue to expand a little, keep the small fire, until the opening laughter all cracked, the surface is also showing a crisp golden yellow, you can come out of the pot.

![step 14]({{site.baseurl}}/img/435428/14.jpg)

## step 15:

The fried mouth laugh can see the surface is still bubbling, just looking at it I can imagine how crisp it is. I wish I could eat one as soon as possible. That's how the food is developed, Ouch ().
