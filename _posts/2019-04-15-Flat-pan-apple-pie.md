# Steps

## step 1:

Apple dicing, like granular dicing, because I use southern wonton bag, thin and small, so cut some.

## step 2:

In a pan, put a small amount of water and ice sugar into the pan and boil with apple dice. How can you call it a small amount or an appropriate amount? You can just accept the sweetness of the apple boiled with ice sugar, and the water can melt ice sugar. I used a small spoonful of ice sugar to boil it until the apple is soft. The soup will be sticky. Don't use excess soup when wrapping. If you like Gouqin, you can add water to it.Powder, I didn't add it.

## step 3:

Take a wonton skin and spread it on a flat surface with some oil in the middle, but don't paint the edge, otherwise it won't stick to the mouth in a moment. I wipe it with the bottom of my spoon.

## step 4:

Take another piece of skin and fold it up. You can arrange several pieces of skin one by one. I only fold two layers. It feels crisp. I tried three layers. The inner layer will be soft. I like it. Of course, it affects the amount of skin you prepare. I just wrapped the filling of an apple with six folded skins.

## step 5:

Pile up Apple stuffing on the side of the skin, fold the skin in half, press the edge with a small fork, and seal easily and nicely.

## step 6:

Place oil in a pan, not too much. Pan-fry it in a flat pan, cook it in a small fire, and scorch it in a big fire. Remember to turn it over. If you have to put more oil, it can be changed into fried, and it's delicious.

# Tips

Eating convenience for children is time-consuming, mini-minded and not worrying about half of the food left or eating too much.The Southern thin square wonton skin is used. The dumpling skin is expected to be too thick. I don't know if it is feasible to fold the thin wonton skin properly. I haven't tried it.
