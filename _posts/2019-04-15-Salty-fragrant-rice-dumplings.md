# Tips

Apart from pork and glutinous rice, I had a rough estimate of everything else.Shelled mungbean kernels and flower beans I bought online, and chestnuts were brought from Guangxi.What can't be bought by supermarkets in vegetable markets can be bought online by relatives.Zongzi is delicious, but for people with bad stomach, try to eat less, because glutinous rice is not easy to digest.
