# Tips

1. The amount of sugar added according to their own taste.It's sweet and salty. Usually it's added with a proper amount of pepper leaf powder (sugar instead: salt 1 G + pepper leaf powder 1 g).2. Some milk can be exchanged for equal amount of eggs.3. Be sure to braze lightly and prevent it from burning.4. It feels very smooth when flipping. Just hear the crisp sound.5. Sealed preservation. Suggestion to finish eating as soon as possible.
