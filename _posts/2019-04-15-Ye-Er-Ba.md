## step 5:

Like steamed buns, take a small ball, pinch a nest in the middle and add a proper amount of fried meat stuffing, then round into an oval shape, put on the leaves.

# Tips

The ratio of fat to lean is better at 5:5. I have too much lean meat and fried it with lard in the middle.If you don't have leaves, you can use grapefruit leaves, corn husks and bamboo leaves.
