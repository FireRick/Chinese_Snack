# Introduction

**"For a native Liuzhou fish of Benxian Fish King, a bowl of ordinary snail powder can not satisfy the taste bud for a long time, but the so-called"three fresh"or"flower shell snail powder"sold in stores gives poor meat.So I decided to make a luxurious version of the seafood snail powder by myself. The shrimp should be big, the flower nail should be tender and fat, the meat quantity should be more, and the absolutely reasonable kind of buckwheat ~and directly use the snail powder on hand. It's difficult to down immediately! "**
