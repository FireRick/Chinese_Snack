# Introduction

**"The snack we tried to make deserves to be called net cabbage. The whole family loved it very much. The second time we cooked it, it was sent to the children upstairs. Unexpectedly, two days later, her mother knocked on the door and said that her children were crying and crying for food. There was no way but to"go downstairs and learn art".So this snack is the children's favorite.**

# Tips

1. After putting in the yolk, you must wait until the egg juice is finalized before turning it over.2. After trying, the whole family agreed that tomato tastes the best. Here we suggest that if you give them to children, they can also make strawberry, apple, hawthorn, cherry and so on.
