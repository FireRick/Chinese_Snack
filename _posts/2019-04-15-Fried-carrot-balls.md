# Tips

When you add flour, you add or subtract it according to your own situation. If you have more flour, add some water.If you don't like crisp pills, you don't have to turn the dough twice. The purpose of turning the dough twice is to make the skin crisp. If you like soft pills, turn the dough once.~
