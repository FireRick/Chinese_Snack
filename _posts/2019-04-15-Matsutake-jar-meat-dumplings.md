# Matsutake jar meat dumplings

# Introduction

**"There's a bunch of fungi in the fridge. There's no name tag. I don't know what they are.The guess is matsutake, because once a pile of matsutake was so frozen in the refrigerator, because it seems that only matsutake is worth such a pile in the refrigerator.Now the question is how to eat them.Wandering aimlessly, looking for everything about matsutake, you can see a matsutake meat dumpling in a flash.I haven't really thought about zongzi. It's just before the Dragon Boat Festival. We can also have a matsutake zongzi for the occasion.Don't bother to make pork. That jar of pork is just beautiful pork, but it belongs to pickled meat.Pick up a pool and cut it into small pieces, so that it can be evenly distributed in the dumplings, and then stir-fry the grease to reduce some calories.The fungus is very fragrant, more and more convinced that it is matsutake.It seems that there are more fungi cut into small grains than rice, just like the feeling that this dish is more than rice.It seems that after a long time cooking, the fresh rice dumplings are soft and give off the unique fragrance of fungi.Black glutinous rice has not been cooked beforehand, the kind of granular feeling chewed is really good...**
