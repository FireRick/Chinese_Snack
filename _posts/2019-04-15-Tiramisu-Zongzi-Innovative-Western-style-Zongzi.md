It is recommended to soak glutinous rice for at least 2 hours and at most 8 hours.4. Cheese cubes are very easy to make in summer. It is suggested to take 2 or 3 cheese cubes out of the refrigerator at a time and wrap them before taking them.5. For the beauty of the finished products, it is suggested that the dumplings should be folded only once, so that the redundant parts can be cut off.6. When putting rice dumplings, remember to adjust the position slightly to ensure that they are all in the same height and can all submerge in the water.7.
