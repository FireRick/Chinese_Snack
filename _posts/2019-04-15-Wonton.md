## step 1:

First, talk about noodles, warm water and noodles the night before.Add 1 teaspoon of salt to a bowl of noodles and make dough a little softer and not too hard. Spread the dough with a greasy food bag and put it in the refrigerator overnight.I used chicken, carrot, celery, apricot, abalone mushroom and shallot with corn oil, oyster oil, salt and five spices powder to stir in one direction.Soup I chose laver, spinach, eggs and a small bowl of beef with soy sauce. I couldn't chew the gluten and put it in the soup.
