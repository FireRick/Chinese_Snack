# Tips

When the dumplings are wrapped, they can be boiled directly with water or steamed separately. I am steamed separately.It takes about 30 to 40 minutes.The fillings can be changed according to personal preferences, or they can be filled with jujubes and dried fruits.Because various brands of sago may be easy to steamed or not easy to ripen, Jianyi opened one after 30 minutes to see if it is ripe, if not ripe, then put it back and steamed until it is ripe.This kind of sago is small and easy to cook.Can not eat so much at one time can be stored in the refrigerator, want to eat when steaming back to the oven and restore Q glutinous teeth.
