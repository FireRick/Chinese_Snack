# Steps

## step 1:

Wash the red beans and pour them into the health pot. Add water and the ratio of red beans to 1:1. Selected mode: Stew soup defaults to 40 minutes and then manually increases 15 minutes. After the first stew, add sugar to water to ensure that the ratio of beans to water continues to be 1:1 before the second boil, then find the mode above and continue to boil for 50 minutes to observe the beans flowering after this boil time.If the boiling is soft, then if it is still hard, continue to cook for 40 minutes for the third time according to the second step, during which the ratio of beans to water is guaranteed to be 1:1.

## step 2:

After boiling, the honey beans should be soft, but not all of them will become bean paste to a certain extent. After the second boiling, 75% of the finished products will be cooked and poured into a clean container or sealed cans. When eating in a clean spoon, take out the right amount.
