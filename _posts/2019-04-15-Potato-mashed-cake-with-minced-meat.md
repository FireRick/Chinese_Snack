# Tips

If you like fat, you can also add colorful meat or other side dishes.Special moulds can be used to fry, the shape is more beautiful.Without patience, a whole pan can be pressed flat and cooked.I use love and Mickey's mold. It's time-consuming. The mold should be greased first to avoid sticking and affecting the shape.And I use a flat-bottomed electric frying pan, which is not sticky and can be steamed and fried.
