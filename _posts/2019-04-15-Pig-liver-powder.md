# Introduction

**"Pork liver powder is one of the most common snacks in street snack shops. For some time, it was especially infatuated with pork liver powder. So they often went out to street snacks. But it was delicious. Heavy oil and heavy salt were too hot. The key point was that they were afraid of being dirty. These days, they got several cans of high-quality bean paste and soybean paste. They just brought boiled rice powder to eat. The taste was 100 times better than that outside.I'm afraid we'll have rice noodles every day these days.**
