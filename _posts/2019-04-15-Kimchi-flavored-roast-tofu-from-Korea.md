# Introduction

**"A few days ago, nine flavors of baked-wing pickles, Orleans, baked, Turkish, and Korean kimchi were introduced.Suddenly I wanted to try kimchi in Korea. But I had enough chicken wings and legs to roast every day. What new pattern should I change?Turn around in the vegetable market, turn around for half a day without thinking about what to do, suddenly saw the tofu seller, suddenly remembered that baked tofu came, so spent 2 yuan and 5 to buy a tofu, a few shallots, flew home to start baking tofu.This kimchi roasted tofu is the favorite of lazy people. It doesn't need to be fried, stewed, fried, or even a drop of water. It only needs a package of sauce and an oven. Is it easy?Come on, let's bake together!"**

## step 3:

Place tin paper on the baking tray and brush it with oil. I use butter or other oil. The main purpose is not to stick to it when baking, but also to bake tofu golden easily.

## step 6:

Use a brush to dip in a small amount of oil and sprinkle it on tofu.Note that you must not brush directly because the brush will brush away the marinade.Conditional oil can also be put into a small sprinkler, spray, so that more symmetrical effect is better.

## step 7:

The oven is preheated at 180 degrees. The middle layer is heated up and down. The oven is baked for about 25 minutes.It's normal for tofu to get bigger and smaller in the middle.

# Tips

1. If there is no pickle at home, you can also use the sauce of spicy cabbage to marinate tofu. During the roasting process, brush the sauce of spicy cabbage once in about 5 minutes, and brush more times to make the same taste.2. Korean kimchi-flavored baked-wing pickles contain salt, without any additional condiments.3. White sesame seeds can be sprinkled at home, which is more fragrant!
