# Introduction

**"The autumn weather becomes dry, the diet should be based on Nourishing Yin and clearing heat, moistening dryness and quenching thirst, and calming the mind. In autumn, we might as well eat more lotus seed soup and lotus root vegetables!Lotus root is also our usual home-cooked dish. Fried, stewed and cooked salad is a very delicious dish no matter how we do it.Today, we recommend this delicious lotus root powder black sesame dumpling with unique taste. The soup is soft, smooth and has a light lotus root fragrance. The black sesame dumpling in the mouth is mellow and fragrant.My Wechat Public Number [Rhododendron Cuisine], after paying attention to it, you can check out the delicious recipes I edit carefully for you every day and how thin you are!It also has a light fragrance of osmanthus and tastes much better than boiled dumplings in clear water.**

# Steps

## step 1:

The ripe black sesame is beaten into powder, and fine sugar and lard are added to the black sesame powder.I use fine granulated sugar (fine granulated sugar is easy to dissolve into the filling), lard 10 grams, a little is enough, some formulations lard consumption is very large, too much lard dumplings will be very greasy to eat.Black sesame meal can't be kneaded into a ball without lard, but it's easy to knead into a small ball with a little clear water.*

## step 2:

The glutinous rice flour can be added to 120 grams of warm boiling water, which is slightly hot.Hot boiling water and glutinous rice flour will cook the flour, and the bag is very sticky.So I use about 50 - 60 degrees of warm boiling water.

## step 4:

Take a proper amount of glutinous rice dough and wrap it in a black sesame stuffing.After closing the mouth, squeeze the dumplings tightly by hand first, and then reunite with the palms of both hands.

## step 5:

Sprinkle a little dry glutinous rice flour on the plate to prevent sticking. Then wrap all the dumplings in turn. If you can't finish cooking at one time, freeze them in the refrigerator directly.If you don't want to bother, you can buy ready-made black sesame dumplings directly in the supermarket, and the taste is good!

## step 7:

Cut the lotus root into small sections and then add water to make mud. Beat it several times more. It tastes better if you make it delicate.You can also buy ready-made lotus root flour in supermarkets and boil it after adding water. If you can't buy lotus root flour, you can use a section of lotus root to make mud.
