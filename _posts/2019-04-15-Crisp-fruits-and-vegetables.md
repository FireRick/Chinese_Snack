## step 4:

The reason for using pitaya fruit as an example is that it is difficult to master the high temperature discoloration of Pitaya fruit. When it is done, it must not exceed 150 C. When it is just baked, it is okay to be a little soft. When the wind blows for a few seconds, it will be crisp.
