## step 1:

Take a clean basin, 500 grams of flour, 3 grams of salt, add appropriate amount of water to make flocculent.

![step 1]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/1.jpg)

## step 2:

Medium dough, soft and hard, as shown in the figure

![step 2]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/2.jpg)

## step 3:

Cover the wet cloth and wake up for about 30 minutes. Rub it for another 2 minutes to get a smooth dough.

![step 3]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/3.jpg)

## step 4:

Put the smooth dough in a large container. First add 200 grams of water to wash the gluten.

![step 4]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/4.jpg)

## step 5:

When the clear water in the container is thick, filter the washing water into another clean container with a filter.Don't throw the dregs in the filter. It's gluten. Add 200 grams of water and knead the dough.

![step 5]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/5.jpg)

## step 6:

Wash gluten 5 times with 1000 grams of clear water. When you wash gluten 5 or 6 times or so, until the water in the basin is no longer turbid. (Note that every time you wash, repeat step 5.) The remaining yellow piece is gluten, as shown in the figure.

![step 6]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/6.jpg)

## step 7:

Use the filter to filter the washing water at the last time and filter out the gluten residue.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/7.jpg)

## step 8:

After filtering, you get a basin of batter like this.Place one side and lay it in layers for at least four hours. The purpose is to let the starch precipitate in the water.It can also be put overnight and steamed the next day.The longer the batter is deposited, the stronger the cold skin is.

![step 8]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/8.jpg)

## step 9:

The gluten was rubbed repeatedly with yeast, covered with fresh-keeping film and fermented overnight.

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Upper Steam Drawer, as shown, Steam for 20 minutes

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/10.jpg)

## step 11:

Steamed gluten is fluffy and soft, as shown in the figure.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/11.jpg)

## step 12:

After the flour water stays overnight or stays for at least four hours, the starch has sunk, the upper layer becomes clear water, and the clear water is poured out.Slowly pour, don't bring the starch syrup underneath.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/12.jpg)

## step 13:

If it's not clean, you can skim the water out with a flat spoon, leaving only the surface.The movement must be gentle, do not bring out the starch slurry below.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/449198/13.jpg)

## step 14:

The poured starch syrup has become very sticky and hard, and it needs to be stirred with a little strength.Till the mixture is even.Pictured

Prepare two stainless steel plates. I use pizza plates here.Place a thin layer of cooking oil on the plate.

## step 19:

After about 2 minutes of steaming, through the lid of the pot, you can see that the inside of the skin is blistering and bubbling up. Open the lid and take it out.Cool down in a cold basin that's ready next to you.Put another pizza dish filled with pulp into the pot and continue steaming.Two plates steamed faster in turn.

## step 20:

Wait until it's cooler and you don't feel hot. Take off the skin carefully along the edge of the plate.Because it is oiled and cooled by cold water, it will be uncovered very well.
