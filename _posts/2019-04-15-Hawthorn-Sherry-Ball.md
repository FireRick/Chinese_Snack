# Introduction

**"When Dabao was sent to school yesterday, he saw an uncle selling ice-sugar gourds at the door. The ice-sugar gourds are lovely in shape and sweet in taste, and are especially popular with children, including our baby.So Dabao kept asking me to buy her a bunch of ice-sugar gourds, thinking that the ice-sugar gourds sold outside might be added with pigments and additives, and the baby had a bad health, so I told the baby that I would pick her up in the afternoon and buy them for her after school.Then go home and immediately start to make this supplementary food - Hawthorn Sherry Ball, the raw materials used are very simple, without any additives, the baby will eat healthier, the mother will be more assured! __________The rounded Hawthorn mud is coated with granulated sugar, which just neutralizes the sour and astringent taste of hawthorn. It tastes sweet and sour.The thoughtful treasure mother can also use bamboo sticks to string together, it has become a child's favorite "ice-sugar gourd".Children eat a small amount of Hawthorn has the effect of appetizing and digestive aid, but remember not to eat too much, to avoid excessive sugar caused tooth decay.**
