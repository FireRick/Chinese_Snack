# Tips

1. Choose fresh tenderloin meat for beef. It's better for baby to choose fresh meat instead of frozen meat.2. Meat paste can be frozen and preserved for about 2 weeks. Don't take too long. Every time you eat it, it must be heat-permeable. It's best to steamed it. Don't use microwave oven to avoid internal heating.
