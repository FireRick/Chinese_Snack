Take a few litchis (I used 7) and peel off the litchi shell and take out the core (try not to break the flesh of litchi).

# Tips

Pay attention to the amount of water in the bird's nest and the cooking time. If the water is too much or too long, the bird's nest will melt into water without silk slippery feeling.
