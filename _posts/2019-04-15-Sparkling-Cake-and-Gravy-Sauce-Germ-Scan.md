# Introduction

**"See a lot of green sauce recipes, it seems that more used as sauce, and most of them are pasta.How can I use it if it's not used as sauce?Finally, I saw a green sauce Scang, suddenly filling the top.Although not self-made sauce, although there is no bacon, but will not hinder a salty sauce scone.Without bacon, make meat-free green sauce scones.Use all the sauce left in the bottle, and the liquid ingredients are still not enough to make the flour into a ball. Then add some water. Maybe add milk, add a little milk fragrance, but water is the best way.But the oven is missing...To be exact, there is no shortage. The space reserved for the oven has been vacant for only about two weeks.Now that position has been filled, however, the door hinges of the oven are a little defective and can't be closed freely. We have to find time to dismantle the machine and repair it.This month, there is little time and leisure to think about that door, oven can only be a decoration.It doesn't matter if the oven is unavailable. There's also a broken electric cake clank.It just seems that the space between the upper and lower plates is not very high, so it is impossible to bake a thick Scandinavian.Cake pan can also be used as an oven, baking effect is also good, but Scan is very thin, more like a cake.The starch with the germ looks a little rough, while the green sauce gives it a little yellow and green.It tastes good...**
