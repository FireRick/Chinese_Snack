# Tips

1. Adding a little starch to the egg juice can make the egg juice more sticky and solidify faster.2. The onion circle is too thin. It must be overlapped by two or three to form a group. The time of the onion circle frying should not be too long.3. Cut green pepper and ham as fine as possible.
