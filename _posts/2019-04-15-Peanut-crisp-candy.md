# Tips

1. The boiling of syrup is related to the softness and hardness of sugar. When it is too hard to cut, it will break, and it will not move. If it is too soft, it will stick to the hand, so it must be controlled well.2. Peanuts must be kept warm after baking, so that they can be easily touched when mixed with syrup.3. Cut it when it's cool. Don't wait until it's completely cool. It's easy to break.
