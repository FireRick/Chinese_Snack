## step 3:

It's a sauce. It's easy to make. Heat the sauce in the pot, then add soy sauce, sugar, two pieces of sufu, starch and water.I didn't put salt, because the curd is very salty, and then put salt is too salty.The viscosity of starch can be controlled by oneself. Add it little by little, and you can see that the consistency is about the same.

It tastes very fragrant.It's better than buying it!
