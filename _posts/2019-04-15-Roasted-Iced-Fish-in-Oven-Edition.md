# Introduction

**"This ice fish from Antarctica is also called Antarctic shrimp fish, which grows below 0 degrees in the deep sea of Antarctica. It is pollution-free fish. Antarctic shrimp is used as food and refuses to eat all kinds of food. For the first time, I have eaten this fish, but Antarctic cod has tasted it many times and is very delicious.Fish fillet and fish spine are also less, the elderly and children are also suitable for eating, zero melting "when you get home, still frozen Gaga! Direct thawing, to a barbecue taste, meat thick, tender and compact, sweet and smooth, roasted out of the house fragrant.""**
