# Introduction

**"The same batter, different ways of cooking, will become different pastries.In the oven, it's for cake; in the steamer, it's for cake; in the frying pan or electric cake pan, it's for muffin.Yellow peach paste deduces different foods.Not wanting to encounter pulp particles in muffins, I finally decided to put yellow peaches into the machine and stir them into mud.Of course, add eggs and sugar, which may help keep it from browning so fast.Then it was found that the color did not change from stirring to pouring out.Spread the batter into the electric cake pan, cover it, and guess when it should be uncovered is a beautiful brown.There are always differences in the end of each pot. The best one is the first pot.Yellow peaches make the muffins look beautiful and golden under the fried color. They look very attractive.Not very sweet, but very fragrant....**
