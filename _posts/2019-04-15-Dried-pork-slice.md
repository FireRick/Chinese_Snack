# Introduction

**"Dried pork used to be so simple. It tasted better than those sold outside. When I was a child, dried pork was my favorite snack. It was delicious and chewy.However, it was a luxury to eat a piece at that time, and it was not enough to eat every time.When I grew up, I found that the method of preserved pork was not so complicated. With a cooking machine, there was no need to cut pork manually. After all the materials were ready, they were put in the oven and taken out. The room was full of fragrance. Finally, I could enjoy it in a big mouthful.Fresh pork is salted and beaten into mashed meat, brushed with honey to make the color more attractive, full of white sesame and black pepper to make the taste of preserved pork more delicious, tender but not wood, full of chewing power.As a leisure snack in the office, or a picnic food, are excellent choices.**
