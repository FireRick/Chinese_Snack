# Introduction

**"Our family loves roasted sweet potatoes most, but it is unhealthy to roast through the stall. On the one hand, they use chemical barrels, on the other hand, they will be smoked when roasting.Recently, I started a dry-roasted, quick-cold and unbreakable Heile casserole. After receiving it, I tried to roast sweet potatoes. It was very simple. According to the online method, the potatoes were roasted in tens of minutes. In the future, I will be able to eat sweet potatoes without going out.**

# Tips

1. Sweet potatoes should be of the same size as possible. It is suggested that small sweet potatoes be used to roast faster.2. Turn over regularly in the process of baking, and wipe the water in the pot at the same time, so that the baked sweet potatoes will not scorch, nor will they be wet, moderately dry, soft, glutinous and sweet.
