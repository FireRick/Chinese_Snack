# Tips

1. Fire climate is very important. Fire carelessly blurred and bitter. It is not easy for small fire to mature and hard skin, so choose medium fire.In addition, when discoloration is tasted, if it is ripe, it will be fished out to prevent skin bitterness for a long time.Because the oil temperature is higher and the color darkens a little slower.2. There is moisture in peanuts just when they are out of the pot. Just hang them for a while.
