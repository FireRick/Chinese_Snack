# Introduction

**"Many people think that dried fruit is less nutritious than fresh fruit, but in fact this understanding is wrong.Compared with fresh fruits, dried fruits do lose more vitamin C, but because of concentration, dried fruits of the same weight contain more minerals and other trace elements than fresh fruits.Fruit dried because of dehydration, easier to preserve and carry, is a suitable snack companion for all ages.Fresh fruits often contain more active proteases, but also tannins, which damage the digestive tract mucosa severely.But the stimulation of dried fruits on the digestive tract is greatly reduced, which is good news for people with indigestion and fear of cold, and there is no need to worry about nausea or stomachache after eating.In addition to being eaten as snacks directly, dried fruits can also be eaten with milk, yogurt, bread and other foods, and can replace sugar as sweeteners.Husband is very busy at work. He often has a punctual lunch.I always put slices of fruit into the drier before going to bed the night before. The dried fruit will be ready the next morning. It's crisp and crisp. It's sweet and sour.Pack a small box for your husband to take away, even if you can't have lunch on time, you can also eat a few pieces of top for a while.In addition, when a small snack is also good, supplement a variety of nutrients at the same time, but also increase plant fiber, promote gastrointestinal peristalsis and digestion.I have been eating dried fruits for 10 days. I don't know whether it's because of the dried fruits or because of the more recent exercise time. My husband's color is more rosy than before, and his stomach is more comfortable.**

# Steps

## step 1:

The fruit dryer is ready. The apple, kiwifruit and lemon surfaces are washed with fine salt and then rinsed. Pineapple peels and digs buds.

## step 2:

Cut the lemon into 1 or 2 mm slices and leave the ends for other use. The lemon seeds can be easily removed.

## step 3:

Cut the apple into 1 or 2 mm thin slices with a sharp knife and soak in cold water for one minute to prevent oxidation.

## step 4:

Pour out the water in the apple slices and squeeze the lemon juice at both ends of the lemon mentioned above into the apple bowl. Lemon is a good antioxidant, which can prevent the apple from being oxidized to brown and affect its beauty.

## step 5:

Cut the pineapple into 2 mm thin slices and soak in dilute salt water for 5 minutes before rinsing again.

## step 6:

The skin of kiwifruit is rich in minerals and protected by the skin. The pulp of kiwifruit is not harmed when it is cut; the thickness of the fruit is about 2 mm; the thickness of all the fruits depends on the individual's knife skill, and the thinner the fruit can be.

## step 7:

Put the fruit slices one layer at the same yard and push them into the mofet dryer. The surface of pineapple slices has more water, which is absorbed by kitchen paper towel and then put in.

## step 8:

Because it was made before going to bed at night, the water content of the four kinds of fruits is different. For the sake of insurance, I set 80 degrees for 4 hours.

## step 9:

After a long sleep, I got up the next day and turned on the fruit dryer. Wow, fresh fruit slices have turned into beautiful dried fruits. Especially the thin apple pulp wrapped in the naturally curved fruit skin has the dancer's movement and demeanor.

## step 10:

Dried pineapples are as beautiful as flowers.

## step 11:

There is no change in the color of the dried apples. The red skin is as beautiful as a skirt.

## step 12:

Kiwifruit slices are dried with skins, and the mineral content is better than peeling.

## step 13:

Lemon dried, clear and transparent, take lemonade with you at any time.

# Tips

Apple slices are easy to oxidize, so first soak in cold water for 1 minute, then cover the surface with lemon juice; pineapple contains allergenic substances, which should be soaked in dilute salt water for 5 minutes and then rinsed with clean water. Drying the surface with paper towel can shorten the time of making dried fruit.
