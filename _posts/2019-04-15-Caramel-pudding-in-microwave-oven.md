## step 1:

The first step is to make caramel.Sugar with a little warm water, do not submerge sugar, add some osmanthus (deliberately not added) stirring, and then microwave oven high heat for 2 minutes, after the oven quickly add water stirring and stirring, otherwise the bottom of the bowl will be stained.I just failed, but it doesn't matter. Caramel water tastes good too.~

It doesn't matter if you mix it. After a while, the buckle will turn up.Shake the mould a little and defoam it.
