# Tips

/ About chicken/1, the video selected chicken leg meat with skin. The meat quality of chicken leg meat is tender, and it will not be too firewood after roasting.During the roasting process, chicken skin will be thinned out of chicken oil, making the shell of chicken steak fried, and more fragrant and crisp.2. If you like a partner with lower calories, you can choose chicken breast.But the roasting time needs to see the chicken size reduced correspondingly, otherwise roasted, the taste will be bad.3. Knock chicken to make it taste better./ Bake/1. Put the chicken on the grill and pad the bottom of the grill. It can hold the chicken spare oil and not dirty the oven.2. Both the grill and the baking tray are placed in the lower layer of the oven, because the bottom of the baking tray cushion will insulate part of the bottom temperature, so the grill on the baking tray can make the chicken steak heated evenly, so that the chicken steak is not cooked above, but still raw below.3. You can turn the chicken steak over in the middle of the roast, but you don't want the crust to crumble as gently as possible./ Vanilla / Because I made fried chicken pizza, I used pizza.You can also put comprehensive vanilla, basil and so on.Or according to personal preferences.
