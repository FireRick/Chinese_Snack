# Introduction

**"The other day I went to visit my sister's house. She was busy working in the kitchen. She said that she would prepare tea eggs for breakfast the next day.I hurried to the kitchen to see how she boiled the eggs, because the eggs she boiled were very fragrant and not salty, but tasty. I always wanted to ask her what ingredients she used, and where on earth was different from the way I boiled them.My elder sister said there was no secret, but she used a different pot from me.She said that she used to use casserole to stew slowly, but now she has a stewing pot. It is more convenient to keep the stewing pot warm for one night, so that she can get up the next day to eat hot tea eggs, and after one night's warm soaking, tea eggs have fully absorbed the fragrance of condiments, the taste is just right.Eggs 10, anise 2, pepper 10, fragrant leaf 3, cinnamon 1, small black tea 1 teaspoon ice sugar 5 g soy sauce 1 teaspoon salt.**
