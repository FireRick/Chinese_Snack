## step 9:

Then grasp it with your hand, hold it, and twist it into a ball. Note that the rice balls wrapped in sausage should not be too big, otherwise it will lead to bad lucky bags. If they are too big, you can try to remove some broccoli rice, or cut the sausage a little smaller. This depends on the size of the egg cake you spread. The first one can try, and then you will know the second one.How did you do it?

## step 10:

Take an egg cake and put the rice balls on it. The smaller the rice balls, the better the condition of the lucky bag will be. But it can't be too small, as long as you can leave a nice side for the lucky bag.

# Tips

1. The small scallion leaves selected in the bag should be thinner rather than thicker. It's better to use the slightly "wilting" scallion leaves, because they are fresh and easy to break. The small scallion leaves can be longer, easy to knot, and can be cut later if they are long.2. When laying the egg cakes, we must light fire in the middle, and do not flip. Wait until the egg cakes are completely solidified, then flip them gently, so that the egg cakes will be more golden and tender.3. You can also add some sauce and dip it in. This bag is a good choice for staple food and dishes.
