/ Method/1. To know whether the shrimp is ripe or not, you can insert a bamboo stick to test it and take out the whole without batter or easily.2. If you want the bottom batter to be scorched and crisp, you can also brush oil on the edge of the shrimp eggs after setting to let the oil soak into the bottom and continue to bake./ Preservation / For eggs and seafood reasons, it is recommended to eat them now.
