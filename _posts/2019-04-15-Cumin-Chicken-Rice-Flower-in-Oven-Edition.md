**"Golden chicken flour is one of the most popular snacks. In fact, we can make chicken flour at home. We don't need fried chicken flour. We only need to bake it in oven, and the taste is crisp.The method is very simple. Two small pieces of chicken breast can make more than 20 pieces of chicken flour. Compared with some fast food restaurants, a small package of chicken flour costs about 10 yuan. It's too cheap to make, and it's more comfortable to eat, not greasy.**
