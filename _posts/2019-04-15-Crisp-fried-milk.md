## step 6:

Because hot water will set the milk with raw powder, so stir it until it is slippery with sticky silk. I'm a little overdone. Someone asked why not heat it directly in the pot. I want to say that if you don't master the heat well, it will paste and affect the quality of fried milk.

# Tips

If you want the soft spot in fried milk, you should reduce the amount of raw powder. When heated in hot water, you should not heat it too long. It's just silky and slippery. The temperature of fried milk is also important. For the sake of delicacy, make more.
