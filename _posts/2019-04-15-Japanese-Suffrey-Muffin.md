# Steps

## step 1:

First of all, take out 10g butter and melt it in hot water, or put it into the microwave oven for a bite, and heat it until the butter melts completely into a liquid.

## step 2:

Then separate the mayonnaise and egg white into two clean bowls. Add 20g sugar into the yolk and beat it with eggs.

## step 3:

Stir and pour in the melted butter until the butter and yolk are completely mixed.

## step 4:

Then slowly pour in the milk and mix it well.

![step 4]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/4.jpg)

## step 5:

Screening 40 g low flour and 2 g baking soda together into the mixed yolk liquid, stirring to the flour that can be sifted without dry flour will be more loose and delicate, more convenient to mix, not easy to produce flour bumps, and the mixed batter is also more delicate.

![step 5]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/5.jpg)

## step 6:

Do not stir eggs in circles when stirring, or flour tendons easily, so that the cake is easy to collapse, the taste is not so soft, remember oh.

![step 6]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/6.jpg)

## step 7:

Then began to whisk protein frost, but also routine operation Ha, separated egg white squeezed into lemon juice whisk to wet state, add the first sugar to continue to whisk.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/7.jpg)

## step 8:

In order to make the frost more stable, 55g of granulated sugar was added 3 to 4 times, each time until the granulated sugar was completely melted, and then the next time, until it reached the state of a small hook.

![step 8]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/8.jpg)

## step 9:

At this time, the protein cream is very delicate. Turn the bowl upside down and it won't flow. This will prove that your protein cream is ready.

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Then with a scraper, first pick 1/3 of the protein cream into the yolk paste, let the protein cream and oil mix completely, mix evenly, and then add 1/3 of the protein cream to continue mixing.

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/10.jpg)

## step 11:

The egg yolk paste is added in three times, so it will be easier to mix evenly and more stable. If we mix it into the invisible white protein cream, it will be OK. Don't mix it excessively, it will easily cause defoaming.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/11.jpg)

## step 12:

Next, open a small fire to heat the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes. After the pan is heated, brush a thin layer of corn oil on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking, and brush a little oil on the mousse mold to facilitate later demoulding. The mold I used here is 4 inches. According to the composition of my formula, I can make three sizes.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/12.jpg)

## step 13:

At this time, put the prepared batter into the mould evenly, must put more than 8 cents full, there will be slight expansion in the frying process, it does not matter, so that the cake will not easily collapse and then add a small amount of water along the edge of the pot, cover the lid and fry for 10 minutes, the fat Muffin is heated by this water into water vapor to make its taste soft and moist, if not added.If water is used, it will become dry and easy to fry.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/13.jpg)

## step 14:

Then turn it over, add a small amount of water, cover it and fry for 10 minutes. The side of the frying is golden. At this time, the fragrance has begun to float continuously.~

## step 15:

Fried on both sides can be directly out of the pot, do not need to cool oh.

![step 15]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/15.jpg)

## step 16:

When demoulding, carefully scrape along the edge of the mousse circle, and then demould.

![step 16]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/16.jpg)

## step 17:

In this way, the fat muffin came out perfectly, sprinkled with a layer of sweet butter / Casta sauce, you can tell, to see this layer of cotton-like butter on the surface, I already want to eat.

![step 17]({{site.baseurl}}/img/433514/17.jpg)

## step 18:

Add a little fruit as a decoration and you'll get it done. You must remember to take advantage of it!Hot!Eat!This fat fufufu soft fufu fufu pie needs to take advantage of the hot fufufufufufufu taste to be the best. Oh, puffy muffin with some strawberry jam made by oneself, and then put some fresh cream strawberries, this season's cream strawberries, sour and sweet are also very delicious.~
