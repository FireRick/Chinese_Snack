# Introduction

**"Qianzai rice fruit is the favorite fruit of Chaoshan people in Guangdong Province.The glutinous rice flour dough is boiled in boiling water and dipped in peanut, sesame and sugar mixed in advance.My native northerner likes this snack when he sees it. When he makes it, he adjusts it slightly: using milk and glutinous rice flour to increase the nutrition of rice fruit, and the taste of rice fruit is better.Walnuts are added to the dipping material, which makes the taste richer and nutritious.Personally, Qian Zai Miguo and Tangyuan can be brothers.Tangyuan is glutinous rice flour and noodles, which are wrapped with fillings and cooked.Qianzai rice fruit is glutinous rice flour and noodles, cooked and dipped in stuffing to eat.In other words, Qian Zai Miguo is a kind of dumpling with stuffing glued to the outside of the dough.No matter how you understand it, Qian Zai Miguo is a very attractive and simple delicacy.**
