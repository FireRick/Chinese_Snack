## step 3:

Steamed sweet potatoes.Sweet potatoes bought today are not very wet and have a slightly waxy taste, so I added a lot of milk in the next steps.If you buy a steamed one that tastes sweet, you probably don't need too much milk.

## step 25.0:

I didn't have anything to pack, so I put it in a tin carton and covered it with a plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator to freeze.Just take it out and fry it while you're eating.Or just finished directly with egg liquid wrapped in bread chaff can be fried in a frying pan.

## step 26.0:

Heat the pan, add vegetable oil, burn until 70% heat is changed into small fire, then deep-fry the ball.After freezing, take out without freezing, fry directly in a frying pan.It can also be wrapped in egg juice and fried with bread chaff.

## step 27.0:

I was going to wrap egg liquid bread bran, but I didn't care about the frying pan when I fried it. The Pan had to keep turning or it would overheat. So after wrapping it for a few times, I didn't touch the egg liquid bread bran any more and fried it directly.
