# Introduction

**"Every summer, I like to cook soybeans. The simplest delicacy is to cook them once or twice a week, drink and eat, watch TV snacks. My family loves them, especially the children. They cook a pot and eat it up in a short time.Lecithin in soybean is one of the indispensable nutrients for brain development. It can improve the memory and intelligence of the brain and is suitable for children to eat.Frequent eating in summer can also compensate for the loss of potassium caused by excessive sweating, thus alleviating fatigue and increasing appetite.This is also seasonal dish. Now the market is obviously less. It's really going to be next year if we don't eat any more.**
