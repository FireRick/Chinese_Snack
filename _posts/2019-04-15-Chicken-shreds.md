# Tips

1. Chicken breast is cooked in a cold underwater pot with ginger slices and cooking wine to help remove the fishy smell. It is easy to boil chopsticks until they are bloodless, then boil them for two minutes, then pull them out and tear them into shreds. 2. Cool skin is soaked in salt-added cold and white boiling water for sanitation; 3. Cucumber slices are more crisp, and spices like chili oil can be added.
