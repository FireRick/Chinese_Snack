## step 11:

The surface can be squeezed without adding tomato sauce and sprinkled with firewood flowers (Muyuhua), which looks better and tastes better.What else can you do without throwing anything?Seaweed crumbs, salad dressing and meat floss are all available.Baby is still small, do not insert bamboo sticks, eat dangerous.Older children, even with bamboo sticks, can not eat while walking in case of wrestling accidents.
