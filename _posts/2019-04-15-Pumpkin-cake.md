# Tips

/ dough / 1. Because the water content of pumpkin of different varieties and the water absorption of glutinous rice flour of different brands are different, the 100g glutinous rice flour used in the formulation is the reference value, and the actual dosage depends on the degree of dryness and wetness of dough.2. If the water content of pumpkin is high, add a small amount of glutinous rice flour several times to adjust.Pumpkin water is less, while a small amount of multiple heating water adjustment.3. When dough is not used, it should be wrapped with fresh-keeping film to prevent the surface from drying and cracking./ After steaming/pumpkin cake is put into the steaming cage, the top of the steaming cage is covered with a tea towel or a steaming cage cloth and then covered with a pot cover, which can prevent the droplets from falling on the pumpkin cake during the steaming process, resulting in excessive water content collapse and uneven surface of the pumpkin cake./ Anti-sticking/1. Packing oil paper on the bottom of pumpkin cake can prevent dough from sticking to steaming cage or container.2. Even with oil paper, the fresh steamed pumpkin cake will stick to the hand. Pumpkin cake should be thoroughly cooled before tearing off the oil paper.No bothersome little partner can also brush the oil paper umbrella with thin oil and put the pumpkin pie, which can reduce the degree of adhesion./ Preservation/refrigeration can be kept for about 1 week, freezing for about 3 weeks, and food needs to be reheated.
