# Introduction

**"Every time you go to a fast food restaurant, besides the dazzling variety of hamburgers and the hesitation to make a choice, there's also a good partner - French fries, which is also essential.At first I thought the chips were thin and crisp, especially when dipped in tomato sauce.But after a few times, the fries only feel soft in the end, because it is too thin, the packaging can not breathe enough, the hot air eventually turns into water vapor, the more delicious it is, the less delicious it is.So recently, we found that potato chips are a more crisp snack than potato chips, and they are much bigger and tastes better.**
