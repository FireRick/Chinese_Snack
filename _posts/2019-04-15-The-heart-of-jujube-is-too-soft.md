# Introduction

**"Eating three jujubes a day will never get old, which proves that jujubes are good for women.It is because jujube is rich in vitamin C and cyclic adenosine phosphate, which can promote the metabolism of skin cells. Frequent consumption will make the face ruddy and has the function of nourishing the face and blood.Some people are not accustomed to the taste of jujube when they eat dry. When they add glutinous rice balls in the middle, they will neutralize the odor of jujube and have more chewing power. They taste sweet but not greasy. They can serve as a snack in the afternoon.**
