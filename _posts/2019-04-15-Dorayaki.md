# Tips

1. When the non-stick pan roasts the gong, if the minimum heat is too heavy, turn off the fire in the middle, or lift the pan a little away from the fire source, especially after the back pan is hot, it is better to roast one, otherwise it is difficult to control the degree of color.2. The amount of flour and milk in the batter baked with gongs is not very strict. The batter is thick and can add a little more milk. It feels thin and can add a little more flour. The batter is in the state of picking up the egg beater. The batter can drip smoothly and the lines will not disappear immediately.
