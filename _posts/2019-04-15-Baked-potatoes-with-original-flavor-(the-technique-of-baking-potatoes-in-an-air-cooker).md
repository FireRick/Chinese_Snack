## step 2:

The air cooker is preheated at 180 degrees for five minutes.Then transfer to two Baidu.Put the potatoes in.Set the time to 40 minutes.Examine the water in the potatoes.Roast for 20 minutes and turn the dough over. When you touch the potato with your hands, it's still a little hard.

Then we set the temperature to 230 degrees.20 minutes, every five minutes.The baked potatoes are particularly soft to rake.The skin of baked potatoes is wrinkled.It's just soft to touch.

## step 4:

I use dried pepper with monosodium glutamate and a little salt.Mix a sauce dish and dip it in.Noodles are very delicious.If you don't like chili, change that chili noodle into barbecue powder.

# Tips

When baking potatoes, there must be nothing in them to keep their original flavor.If you don't like to eat dry dishes, it's OK to dip them in your mother's hands.
