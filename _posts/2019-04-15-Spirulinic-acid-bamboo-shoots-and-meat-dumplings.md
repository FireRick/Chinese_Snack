# Introduction

**"The annual battle of sweet and salty dumplings is about to start again. As a loyal supporter of the Salt Dumplings Party, Ben Xianyu has come up with a"dark dish"that will make the Sweet Dumplings cowardly - spiral sour bamboo shoots and meat dumplings!The sour and hot taste is quite stimulating to the taste buds. I'm afraid it depends on whether the salty dumplings can turn over in the war between salt and sweetness this year. I'm afraid it's a haha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha**

## step 9:

Before wrapping dumplings, the end of the leaves of the dumplings should be pruned properly to make the wrapped dumplings more beautiful * the leaves of the dumplings can be boiled slightly in advance.

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/403293/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Hold one third of the leaves near one end of the dumplings in a funnel shape, and then start filling glutinous rice. Be careful not to let the bottom of the dumplings hollow out. This will not only affect the taste of the dumplings, but also the juice mixed in the glutinous rice will drip everywhere...

When rice dumplings are boiled in the pot, at least the water in the pot must be overflowing, so that the rice dumplings can be heated evenly.

# Tips

(1) Spicy oil packages must be added according to their own needs, not to eat spicy small partners can be replaced by fragrant oil or other animal oil; (2) If you think the cooking pot is too long, you can replace it with a pressure cooker. The length of time depends on the size and quantity of zongzi, but it should be at least 40 minutes or more.
