# Tips

The preheating of the braised beaker is very important. This step can not be omitted. It is to add 100 degree boiling water to the braised beaker, cover it and braise for 5 to 10 minutes. After preheating, the effect will be better.Cinnamon or fennel, grass and fruit can also be put at home, no black tea bag can be used directly with black tea.
