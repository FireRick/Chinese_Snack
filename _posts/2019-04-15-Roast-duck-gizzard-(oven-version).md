# Introduction

**"Speaking of Ji Chuan, I really like it, especially the roast duck gizzard. It's just true love that lasts for ten years.Every time I go to barbecue, beef and mutton can not be ordered, but duck gills must first come to the bottom. In our side, duck gills are also called duck kidneys, because this term, every time I write a composition, there are always small partners to correct me. Today I will come back to Encyclopedia, let's talk about the delicious way of roast duck gills.Duck gills are also called duck gills (Yinzhun), duck butterflies and county liver. They are the stomach of ducks.This part is tough, chewy, long-lasting, non-greasy, iron content is particularly rich, usually appropriate to eat more iron can also supplement it.Okay, to get to the point, what we are doing today is making roast duck gills at home. These sliced duck gills are sprinkled with cumin and chili powder. They are chewy and have a sense of Q. After eating a bunch of duck gills, we want to have a bunch of them.**
