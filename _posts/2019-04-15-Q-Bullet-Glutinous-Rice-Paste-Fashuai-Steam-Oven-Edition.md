# Tips

1. The proportion of glutinous rice to water is very important. If there is too much water, it will not be done.2. When the glutinous rice dough is not ripe, you can use tools to punch in the flour to see if there is wet paste sticking to the surface, if not.3. Intrapsulation can be replaced by food you like.
