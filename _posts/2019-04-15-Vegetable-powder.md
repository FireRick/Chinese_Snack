## step 5:

Hang in the air to dry.I spent 24 hours airing all day, and I almost finished.This is a slice of pumpkin. The slice of carrot was deleted by mistake.

## step 6:

Pumpkin slices I don't have hot water, because the pumpkin is soft and can't be picked up after hot water.Pumpkins were also aired all day or so.

## step 7:

This is a slice of dried carrot. The carrot I bought is smaller and smaller after drying.Vegetable slices need to be thoroughly dried and broken as soon as they are broken.If it's not dry, you can bake it in a pan over a small fire.

## step 8:

After drying, put it into the grinding cup of the machine and beat it into powder.This is a broken purple potato.The drying process is the same as that of carrots.

# Tips

1. It is suggested to use a wiper to wipe the slices. The thickness is uniform and the drying time is about the same.2. Vegetable slices should be aired to a crisp degree and can be roasted in a pan.3. The grinding function of the machine is not very fine and needs sieving.4. I use the natural air-drying method. I can also use the oven to dry at low temperature.
