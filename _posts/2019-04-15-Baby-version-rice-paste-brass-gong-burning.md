Put some flour, rice paste and an egg in the bowl.

## step 2:

Gradually add water, mix flour, rice paste and eggs evenly.The batter should not be too thin. It is thicker than the batter for pancakes. The batter made from too thin is super soft.I tried one, too soft, so I added some noodles.

## step 3:

Preheat the cake pan, brush it with oil, scoop a spoonful of batter and pour it into the cake pan.When the batter changes from sparse to solidified, it can be turned over.At the same time, pay attention to the temperature. This cake of mine is too big. It's heavily colored if you don't pay attention to it.When both sides are painted, the pot will come out.

## step 4:

Bean paste with water, slightly thinner.The bean paste I bought in the supermarket was used to make the rest of the steamed buns.Soya bean paste with water is softer and tastes better. My personal experience is that babies who like to eat dried bean paste do not need to add water.Take a slice of cake, scoop a spoonful of bean paste on the cake and spread it on top, then cover it with a slice of cake, and brass gong will be cooked.
