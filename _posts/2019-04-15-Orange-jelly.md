# Steps

## step 1:

Cut off the top of three oranges with a knife, then slowly dig out the pulp with a spoon. It could have made three orange jelly. As a result, one of them accidentally broke the skin while digging the pulp, so there were only two good orange shells.

## step 2:

Then put the orange pulp into the juicer to squeeze the juice.
