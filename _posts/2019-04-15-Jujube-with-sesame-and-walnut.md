# Introduction

**"There are jujubes and walnuts at home, but they are not very fond of eating like this. Walnuts raw are not delicious, so I think of this good method. It's very simple and delicious. The finished product is crisp and fragrant, and I like it very much."**

## step 3:

Half a spoonful of honey is mixed with half a spoonful of water, so the water can't be much, otherwise the sesame will not stick well if the viscosity is not enough.

## step 4:

The jujube with walnuts in it is dipped in honey water with a brush to expose the side of the walnut. After brushing the honey water, press it in the sesame. The sesame will stick well and put it on the baking tray.

# Tips

Honey and water are better than each other, so that the sesame sticks firmly and the oven temperature is not the same. To increase or decrease the temperature properly, the temperature can not be higher. Don't paste, the jujube will suffer.
