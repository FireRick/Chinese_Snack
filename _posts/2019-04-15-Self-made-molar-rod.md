# Introduction

**"When Amber enters the period of changing teeth, his deciduous teeth always come out before they have lost their new teeth. Every time he encounters this situation, he has to go to the dentist to pull out the deciduous teeth. The trouble is not to mention the pain of the child.Doctors say this is because children usually eat too fine, lack of exercise teeth, to give children to eat more hard things molar teeth, so that not only deciduous teeth easy to fall out, but also good for new teeth.So I usually pay attention to let him eat more corn and other coarse grains, and make him some molar sticks in his spare time.**
