# Introduction

**"Fairy dumplings, in fact, are black powder, which is particularly profound in my childhood memory. When I was a child, I liked eating very much. When I was young, the requirements for eating were very simple. A bowl of frozen fairy dumplings, a piece of glutinous rice dumplings, I could have a happy afternoon.It's hot in summer. Drink a bowl to relieve the heat.In Meizhou, my hometown, the Hakka call it "immortal dumpling". I remember when I went to my grandmother's house, my grandmother cooked water with immortal grass, then added banana honey, which had a different flavor.Now it is more difficult to find fairy grass, boiling is more troublesome, so there is a more convenient and fast alternative, fairy rice flour.**
