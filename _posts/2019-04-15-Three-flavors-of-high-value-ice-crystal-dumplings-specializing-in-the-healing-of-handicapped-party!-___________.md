# Tips

/ The ratio of skin to filling/the ratio of crystal skin to filling can be according to personal preferences. The only condition to be followed is that filling can be put in a little bit more, but the amount of skin should not be too small, otherwise, the dumplings may be torn because of the thin skin./ Zongcotyledon/1. The video is made of dried bamboo leaves. It is suggested that fresh Zongcotyledon be selected as far as possible.The surface of the dried leaves is rough, and the wrapped crystal skin will press the grain of the leaves.And the crystal skin is soft, the dry leaves are oiled, and the anti-sticking effect is not as good as the fresh leaves.2. The commonly used leaves of Zongcotyledon are: tussah leaves, bamboo leaves, reed leaves, etc.Fresh leaves can be purchased and washed directly and scalded with boiling water.Dry leaves need to be soaked in hot water to restore their softness and reuse after washing.3. Leaves of zongkou should be soaked in water when they are not in use, otherwise the surface will be dry and the leaves will roll up.Dry the surface before use./ Anti-stick/1. The pasted cassava flour is sticky and can touch hands with bare hands. It is recommended to take PVC food-grade gloves for operation.2. Applying a thin layer of oil on the leaves of Zongcotyledons can play an anti-sticking role. Vegetable oils with low odor, such as corn oil and salad oil, should be selected./ Gelatinization/1. The temperature of cassava flour gelatinization is between 59-70 degrees. The temperature is too low to gelatinize the batter.So the temperature of the sugar water is very important. After boiling, the sugar water should be poured into cassava flour immediately and stirred. After stirring for a while, the semi-solid batter can be obtained.2. Different brands of cassava flour, different production processes, flour
