# Tips

1. Honey juice and plum sauce are all left over from eating fork roast ah turtle Ling ointment. Honey juice can be replaced by honey, plum sauce can be replaced by green plum juice, or plum wine can also be used.2. In fact, we should add two tablespoons of chili powder here.Because there are pot friends who can't eat spicy food at home, people like to eat spicy food can add it by themselves.~
