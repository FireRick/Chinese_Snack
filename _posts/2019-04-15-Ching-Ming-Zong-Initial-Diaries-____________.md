# Tips

/ Dosage/dosage of moxa paste and flour, reference value of cheese in recipe.Based on the different boiling time of each person, the final component of moxa paste is different and the water absorption of different flour is different. When making dough, the liquid should not be added at one time. First add half or one third of the stirring, then slowly add the adjustment./ Preservation/1. Cooked Qingming rice dumplings should be steamed immediately, and the surface will crack if they are put too long.2. Steamed clear rice dumplings can be sealed and refrigerated for about 4 days after cooling, and steamed hot when eating.
