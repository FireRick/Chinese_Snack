# Introduction

**"Another year in the Youth League season, I think it's really interesting. When I was a kid, there were mugwort in front of and behind the house, but we didn't eat it in our hometown. We didn't find it so delicious until we worked with our friends. Today, I would like to share this sweet version with you for a few days. It's also the way of bamboo shoots with bacon. Oh, there are no friends."**

# Steps

## step 1:

Every place has a different name. There are fresh sellers on Artemisia argyi. It's still fresh when it comes to time. A few of them withered me to soak in the water ahead of time. Drinking water-saturated leaves is like in the soil. It's the same with spinach, which has become very spiritual and dislikes the taste.

## step 2:

Let's start picking vegetables and remove the stems and dead leaves so that the finished product will be more perfect in color.

![step 2]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/2.jpg)

## step 3:

It's really a time-consuming job to get it all right.

![step 3]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/3.jpg)

## step 4:

Prepare ice water in advance, and the cooler the water, the greener the leaves will be.

![step 4]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/4.jpg)

## step 5:

Pour a little more water into the pot, because what I've got to pay more attention to today's dishes is to try not to boil in an iron pot. [Reduce the probability of blackening leaves, though not absolutely]. I boiled it in a casserole and put in a proper amount of baking soda. Specifically, if I haven't weighed more mugwort, I'll boil a little more.

![step 5]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/5.jpg)

## step 6:

After boiling water, put in clean mugwort.

![step 6]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/6.jpg)

## step 7:

Use chopsticks to quickly dial evenly, and mix quickly and continuously to ensure that each leaf will be darker and some will be oxidized and blackened when it is exposed to water.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/7.jpg)

## step 8:

Time can not be boiled too long, about a minute or two, after the pot first put in cold water once.

![step 8]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/8.jpg)

## step 9:

Put it in the ice water you just prepared, and cool it thoroughly and evenly with your hand.

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Extrude the water by hand, do not need to be too dry, put into the juicer can also put a moderate amount of cold and white boil, if you feel bad, if you intend to use mud, the better to break into mud. [The original juicer is the most convenient.)

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/10.jpg)

## step 11:

The back is filtered with gauze.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/11.jpg)

## step 12:

After that, put it in a clean bowl, and remember to cover it with fresh-keeping film. To prevent oxidation, you can make a little more bags at one time and put them in the refrigerator when you want to eat. It's also convenient to take a small bag out when you freeze it. It should be no problem for most of the year.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/12.jpg)

## step 13:

Prepare a bigger container and put in the prepared glutinous rice flour, glutinous rice flour and sugar.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/13.jpg)

## step 14:

Warm water and noodles are the best. Pour them in slowly. When you knead the dough with your hands, it must be soft and hard. You can feel it with your hands.

![step 14]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/14.jpg)

## step 15:

Take a deeper dish and spread it with oil paper to prevent sticking. The kneaded glutinous rice dough is flattened and flattened.

![step 15]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/15.jpg)

## step 16:

Put it in the pot, boiling water and steaming for about 25 minutes is not absolute. You can use chopsticks to insert it to see if there are white spots on the wood or not, it is ripe.

![step 16]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/16.jpg)

## step 17:

When steaming, we will prepare the stuffing today with red bean paste. If you buy it directly, you can make it by yourself. It's not very difficult. Recently, it's not in good condition, so you are too lazy to start.

![step 17]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/17.jpg)

## step 18:

Roll into about 40g.

![step 18]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/18.jpg)

## step 19:

The steamed dough is put into a larger bowl and a small spoonful of lard is added. You can't wear too many gloves and rub them quickly. It's a little hot.

![step 19]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/19.jpg)

## step 20:

Put mud of Artemisia argyi into it at about the same time, and rub it slowly and patiently.

![step 20]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/20.jpg)

## step 21:

Till it's all kneaded together, remember to cover it with a fresh-keeping film.

![step 21]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/21.jpg)

## step 22:

You can see that I can take a flat one at about 30g per serving, and then put the bean paste stuffing that has just been rubbed on it.

![step 22]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/22.jpg)

## step 23:

Tiger mouth tightened, even if wrapped in fresh-keeping film one by one put it away, remember to wear gloves if you use your hands directly will feel good sticky.

![step 23]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/23.jpg)

## step 24:

It's really delicious. I ate two of them immediately after I finished.

![step 24]({{site.baseurl}}/img/450194/24.jpg)

## step 25:

Life is always so unsatisfactory, but we still need to live enthusiastically. There are many things worth loving in life. Don't be discouraged because one is unsatisfactory.
