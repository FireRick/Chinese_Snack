# Steps

## step 1:

It's better to buy the snail lion early in the morning, because the things that spit sand and dirty after soaking for a long time will be cleaned several times, and then put in a little more water. A big spoon of oil is a white porcelain spoon that usually drinks soup. Don't use the spoon foolishly. This is the result of soaking for several hours. The sand and baby inside are all out.

## step 2:

Remember to use a slightly larger hole leak screen to clean and rub with your hands, so it's almost enough to get it back and forth several times.

## step 3:

This is ready-made in the vegetable market. To tell the truth, I made delicious bamboo shoots and sour beans by myself. I remember to soak them for a while and wash them several times, otherwise they are too salty and sour beans.

![step 3]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/3.jpg)

## step 4:

Well, cut the bamboo shoots into thin shreds.

## step 5:

Cut sour beans into small segments.

## step 6:

Soak Auricularia auricula and cut it into thin threads.

![step 6]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/6.jpg)

## step 7:

This is the ingredient that comes with the snail lion powder. It can also be thrown into the snail lion powder. I bought it online. I can trust myself if I want it.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/7.jpg)

## step 8:

Pour the cooked pork rib soup into the soup pot and add the soup bag, without neglecting the small fire to heat slowly.

![step 8]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/8.jpg)

## step 9:

Cut the millet into small pieces and garlic and ginger into foam.

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Oil the pan, heat it and saute garlic and ginger.

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/10.jpg)

## step 11:

Add a spoonful of beans to see, I am a special fragrance of their own secret, today I want to eat a strong point, so add a little more you want to be confident that I can also use other.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/11.jpg)

## step 12:

Stir-fry red oil over low heat.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/12.jpg)

## step 13:

Washed spiral lion into the pot, quickly stir-fry, and then quickly add a spoonful and a half of cooking wine, this is the trick of the spiral lion to suck out half a spoonful of raw smoke.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/13.jpg)

## step 14:

Stir-fry a pot and add some boiling water. I'm thinking about adding spiral lion instead of soup later. So I'll boil it for about seven or eight minutes. I'll taste it and see what's missing. Basically, I don't need to put salt bean paste or raw sauce. I'll see the saltiness of spiral lion meat and the smell of wood.

![step 14]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/14.jpg)

## step 15:

The boiled spiral lion is poured into the soup pot and boiled together.

![step 15]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/15.jpg)

## step 16:

Re-wash the oil in the pan, throw in the sour beans and stir-fry for a while with a little sugar to season. The outside always feels salty. You should also fry the bamboo shoots and agaric filaments separately according to the actual situation.

![step 16]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/16.jpg)

## step 17:

The powder can go into the soup pot.

![step 17]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/17.jpg)

## step 18:

After cooking for a while, I found that the powder was ripe. I dared not cook for too long because I wanted to take pictures. I could season it according to my own taste. I put a little salt and chicken powder in it.

## step 19:

A little green dish is instant-boiled.

![step 19]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/19.jpg)

## step 20:

Put the powder in the prepared bowl and put the ingredients on it. The ingredients are already plentiful. Do you think you should take seriously who calls you like chine?

![step 20]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/20.jpg)

## step 21:

This is called snail lion powder, sucking a snail lion to eat a bowl of powder, the whole body is warm and good for my family, otherwise this taste is estimated to be abandoned, it is estimated that there are many people with heavy taste.

![step 21]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/21.jpg)

## step 22:

It's also a good way to eat alone. I bought two hairy crabs and ugly apples. I'm satisfied with a meal.

![step 22]({{site.baseurl}}/img/427709/22.jpg)

## step 23:

Women cook not to please their husbands and families, but to make life more beautiful.Because cooking itself is an art, people who can express their aesthetic taste and exquisite thoughts with a meal naturally know how to get out of the pressure of life and live a tasty life.
