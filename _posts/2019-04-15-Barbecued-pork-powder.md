# Introduction

**"To ask my children what impresses me most about China, the answer must be Chinese food, especially the sausage powder of Guangdong.They have been fond of sausage powder since childhood. It is necessary to drink tea every time.Last year, I went back to hear from my friend that there was a family flour machine for sale. I immediately asked her to help me buy one. I brought it back from the sea. With this flour artifact, it is much faster to make flour. Every weekend, children can eat their favorite flour.I tried several bowel powder formulas and found that this recipe is the smoothest and closest to the bowel powder made by the snack bar.**
