# Introduction

**"It's always cooked with eggs and pork. It's delicious.One day when I suddenly wanted to eat halogen eggs and didn't prepare red-roasted meat, I put raw and old sauces, oyster oil and eggs together and boiled them, which was unexpectedly delicious!! _________Families like to eat, take to work to colleagues, everyone also said that the taste is good, these two weeks have been boiled three times, more than 50 eggs have gone down, a sense of accomplishment drops greatly..."**
