# Tips

1. When radish is put in salt to kill water, the amount of salt is more than that when stir-frying, so meat need not be put in salt to avoid salty.2. When the pills are fried in oil, don't flip. Deep-fry for a while, shake the pot to avoid excessive flipping and dispersing, and become unshaped.
