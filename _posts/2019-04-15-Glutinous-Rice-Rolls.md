# Steps

## step 1:

Stir-fry the filling with sesame and peanuts (I use them now).

## step 2:

Mash the ripe peanuts and sesame seeds and mix them with flour sugar.

## step 3:

Mix the glutinous rice flour and corn flour in a large bowl that can be used in microwave oven. Add salad milk and sugar (I add 10 grams of tea powder to this tea flavor), and stir slowly until there are no powder particles.Cover and put in the microwave oven. Set 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

## step 4:

After stopping the microwave oven, take it out and put it on the anti-sticking kneading mat to knead quickly and evenly.After a little cooling, roll it into thin sheets with a rolling pin and sprinkle the filling.

## step 5:

After thinning the filling, roll up the flakes from the edge.

![step 5]({{site.baseurl}}/img/404603/5.jpg)

## step 6:

Spread the cooked sesame (or coconut powder) on the kneading mat and roll the flakes until they are covered with sesame (or coconut powder).

## step 7:

Cut into small pieces of suitable size (everyone likes, big or small).Then stick the coconut powder and put it in the box.

## step 8:

This is another red bean paste stuffing with original glutinous rice roll.

## step 9:

Similarly, put the prepared filling in the microwave oven for 3 minutes and 30 seconds.The operation is the same as that of plaster tea.

## step 10:

The original, I first rubbed into long strips, then cut into a pellet of the same size, and then spread thin sheets, put the bean paste filling, and roll up.

## step 11:

The rolled drums were stained with cooked sesame seeds and placed in boxes.

## step 12:

So two boxes of glutinous rice rolls with different tastes are ready.

## step 13.0:

It's coffee time in the afternoon!Put on a cup of coffee with strong fragrance, and then put on the soft, glutinous and sweet glutinous rice cake, which combines Chinese and Western.
