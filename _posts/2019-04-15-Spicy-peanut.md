# Tips

Boiled peanuts and rice need to be salted at the beginning before it tastes good.It will be soft after boiling for an hour, and it will taste good after soaking overnight.If you save time, you can steam the pressure cooker for five minutes, then soak it overnight, just to master the pressure level, if the pressure is completely broken up.It's not fresh peanut, it's dried peanut, so it takes a long time to cook.
