# Introduction

**"Last weekend, Xiaoyu saw a Pearl milk-covered eggs made by a shop with friends in the circle of friends. Although I haven't eaten them, sometimes friends in the circle of friends brush pictures, which makes my heart itchy.I remember when I was a child, there were eggs sold at the school gate. They were baked in the oven. They were very fragrant. They were one of the most unforgettable flavors of my childhood.I remember that at that time, after school, I always bought a few bunches with my little friends and then divided them into several bunches.**
