## step 9:

Turn the fire into a medium one and stir in one direction. If the bubbles are too strong, turn to a low one. Stir until the spoon has resistance, lift the spoon jam to flow slowly and turn off the fire.

## step 10:

After the ceasefire, the glue will solidify quickly. Put it into the prepared packing box as soon as possible while it is hot. Flatten it with a scraper and finish.
