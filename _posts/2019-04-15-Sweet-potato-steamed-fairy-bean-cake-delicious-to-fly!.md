# Tips

1. Different brands of low powder have different water absorption. If the dough is too wet, add a little powder.2. After the purple potato filling is wrapped with cheese, it is suggested that it should be refrigerated for 5 minutes to make it easier to operate.3. When stir-fried purple potato fillings are dry, they can also be added with appropriate amount of butter. If purple potato fillings are not used up, they can be sealed and refrigerated for one week and frozen for one month.4. Because the stuffing is ripe, when frying Xiandoucai, just fry until the skin turns yellow.More recipes and videos can focus on my public number: Little Devil Kitchen can also focus on micro-blog: Makaron Little Devil Woman will be released from time to time.
