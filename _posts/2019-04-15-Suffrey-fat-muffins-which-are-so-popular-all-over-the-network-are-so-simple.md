# Steps

## step 1:

Separate the egg white and yolk and separate them into clean bowls.

## step 2:

Then add 25g milk, 20g yoghurt and 10g corn oil to the yolk and mix well with egg whip.

## step 3:

Add 40g low gluten flour and 2G baking powder to the yolk mixture. Stir the egg whisk zigzag until there is no dry powder. Do not stir in circles to prevent gluten from rising.

## step 4:

Without granular feeling and smoother and delicate, it is OK to lift the egg whipped batter which can slip, and then put it aside.

## step 5:

Then I'll whisk the egg white. The whisker opens at a moderate speed and whisks the egg white to produce many fine fish eye blisters.

## step 6:

Then add granulated sugar to continue beating, in order to make the whitening more stable, 35g granulated sugar is added three times, each time it is completely beaten evenly, the granulated sugar is completely melted and then the next time, the old knowledge is a little bit better.~

## step 7:

When the protein is beaten to the state of rigid foam with crooked hooks, the grain can be clearly seen, and it is more delicate.

## step 8:

Then pick out some of them and mix them in the yolk paste for a few times, then mix them slightly.

## step 9:

Then pour it into the protein cream and continue to mix until the mixture is even.

## step 10:

For ease of operation, I put it in a mounting bag.

![step 10]({{site.baseurl}}/img/429114/10.jpg)

## step 11:

Then we prepare a non-stick pan, put a little corn oil on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking, wipe it with a scraper, or suck it dry with kitchen paper, not too much oil, a thin layer is enough.

![step 11]({{site.baseurl}}/img/429114/11.jpg)

## step 12:

Open a small fire and evenly squeeze out a few small dough with a tape. This muffin is characterized by "fat", so it doesn't matter if the batter is squeezed a little thicker.

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/429114/12.jpg)

## step 13:

Add a small amount of water on the edge, cover the pan and fry for about 3 minutes. The steam can be generated by heating the water, which will accelerate the ripening of the muffin, that is, the reason why it tastes more delicate and moist. If you don't add water, it's easy to fry, and the finished product will be a little dry.

## step 14:

Then turn it carefully with a shovel, cover it with a little water and fry for 3 minutes.

## step 15:

You can fry them on both sides to get out of the pot.

![step 15]({{site.baseurl}}/img/429114/15.jpg)

## step 16:

Finally, you can whip some butter and put it on the muffin.~

## step 17:

Just out of the pot, Shuffle is a fat little cute, put on the table to shake three times!Like Bear Kids, if you stick to this budding state for a few minutes at most, you will shrink and lose your fat fufufu state.So take advantage of it!Hot!Eat!
