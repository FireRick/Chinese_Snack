# Introduction

**"The Youth League is one of the delicacies of the Qingming Dynasty in the south of the Yangtze River.The most authentic is made from wild pulp wort or mugwort.Northeast China is a relatively late season, and it is still a frozen day.I use spinach juice to make green balls. They are very beautiful in color, oily green and sweet in taste.It's very delicious.Steaming one pot is not enough to eat. It tastes super-good and then steamed another pot.**

## step 2:

Rinse the spinach with water, break off each leaf and rinse it again, control the moisture, and cut it into spare parts.A small Juicer will do it. It's very convenient.If there are more green leagues, it is suggested to use a large capacity machine to make juice.

## step 10:

The Youth League is ready, because the bean paste filling is ripe, steamed over high heat for 15 minutes.Use corn leaf mats to keep them from sticking when they are ripe.If not, it can also be padded with drawer cloth or something like that, which is more difficult to wash.
