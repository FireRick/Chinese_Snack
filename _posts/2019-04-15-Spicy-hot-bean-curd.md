# Tips

1. This is steamed soybean skin. It is slightly hard after cooking. When steaming, it can be added a little time, or it can be soft with bubbles (about 20-30 minutes, the time should not be too long or it should be broken). 2. Chili peppers can be seasoned according to their hotness.3. If there is monosodium glutamate to add some, I did not add it, not at home.4. It will be more delicious to eat it one day later.
