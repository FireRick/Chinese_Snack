# Introduction

**Man Ma Kitchen Because I often cook all kinds of delicacies at home, leading to Man Bao eager to try every day, pestering me to cook together.This kind of enthusiasm can not be dispelled, encourage him to start, even if the kitchen upset, but also let him participate in, experience the sense of achievement of their own production.Fruit-flavored milk flakes are manufactured by us at first, pressed into the shape we like, stared at the oven tightly, put them out to cool with a small fan, and then carefully packed into a small jar for preservation. Every step is full of curiosity. We try to finish them carefully. Maybe they taste more fragrant.Because the amount is relatively small, so only a little juice is used, the color is not obvious, there are black spots of kiwifruit.Man Mu hints: Don't do too much, because it is easy to get damp after drying. After all, the equipment at home is not professional and the storage time is short.The longer the baking time is, the softer it is, like cheese candy.The milk tablets sold outside are made by a tablet press, so they are very hard.**
