# Steps

## step 1:

Chicken legs are cleaned first, stamped with toothpicks on them, and some small holes are poked out, which is convenient for the back salting.

## step 2:

I also cut a scratch with a knife and turn over the meat on the chicken leg along the edge of the bone so that it can be fried better and salted better.

## step 3:

Then the slices of ginger, garlic, anise, cooking wine and sauce are poured in. If you like the hot taste, you can put some chili powder in it and marinate it together.

## step 4:

Finally, oyster oil and salt can not be forgotten, put on gloves to make a "horse killing chicken" for the leg, massage it, let it mix well with the seasoning.

## step 5:

Then seal a fresh-keeping film and marinate for one night. The little buddies who are too late should marinate for more than 3 hours at least to make the chicken fully tasty, so that the fried chicken legs are delicious.

We beat two eggs and whip them together.

## step 7:

The pickled hammer was taken out and coated with corn starch, egg juice and bread crumb in turn.

## step 8:

Then you can turn on the hot oil pan and pour a proper amount of cooking oil into the pan, then you can use chopsticks to test the oil temperature at the height of the legs that can be flooded. If there are many small bubbles on the chopsticks, you can almost put the legs off the pan.

## step 9:

The chicken legs are all put into the pot and fried until the surface is golden and crisp. When the chicken legs are fully cooked, the pot will come out.

## step 10:

When you come out of the pot, drain the oil slightly and then fish it out. The remaining oil can also be used to fry vegetables and other things. You can't waste a drop.

## step 11:

The golden hammer thighs were put on the oil paper to control the oil on the dry surface. The fresh chicken thighs were very fragrant, and there were oil bubbles on the surface of the crisp skin. The fragrance had already made me salivate.
