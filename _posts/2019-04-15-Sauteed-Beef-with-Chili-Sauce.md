## step 2:

## step 3:

Wash the beef and cut it into pieces. Add spices (more) and salt to the water.Stew until soft and loose.If you like something chewy, you can cook it carefully.It's better to bring some tendon and fat.

## step 4:

When the meat is cooked, it is cut into small dices.Or long strips.But don't be too big. It's not easy to taste.

## step 7:

Add beef, stir-fry over medium heat until discolored.There's basically no water vapor.(The longer the stir-frying, the harder it will be, so cook it a little longer before, and it's easy to taste, like to chew it.

## step 8:

Add sesame oil and rattan pepper oil.Stir-fry for about 2 minutes.(No, you can't add it. This is just to make it more fragrant.)

## step 9:

Stir-fry the bean paste until fragrant. Turn off the heat.This step is particularly important.(Add pepper noodles, cumin noodles, black pepper noodles, sugar.(Powdered seasoning should not be added as soon as it comes in, and turn off the small fire, otherwise it will be easy to paste, which will affect the taste.Douban paste was taken with them after forgetting to take pictures.Douban paste is to push the meat away, stir-fry it in oil, and then mix the meat with it.

# Tips

1. Too many spices have not been written on the condiment list.So first look at the step chart to see what seasonings are available.2. Specific spices can be increased or decreased according to their preferences and tastes.3. Fire is the first time to stir-fry beef.Stir-fry the water vapor, add spices, too hot pepper noodles will be easy to paste.So change to medium heat, and add chilli noodles, sesame and oyster oil at the end of the fire, just over the fragrance.4. If the sesame seeds are not fried, they should be stir-fried in a clean pot first, so that they will be fragrant.White sesame is a little more colorful than black sesame.Black sesame can be used, but the color is not as good as white sesame.5. Peanut seeds can also be added.
