Next is the hairy noodles, first turn the yeast into warm boiled water (or directly ferment in flour), then add a little baking powder, add some angel steamed bread improver, steamed bun noodles can add more water, and soft, also easy to ferment, the best is to add white sugar (increase taste, help fermentation).

## step 3:

The noodles fermented overnight are sour, which is also what we call fermentation.Add flour, sugar and salt to the fermented starter in turn.Neutralize acidity and alkalinity.The noodles and noodles are ready to be prepared. I even the buns with my hands directly (because there is no rolling stick). Finally, the buns are wrapped up, and the noodles are not needed. They can be steamed directly in a pot, which is convenient and time-saving.
