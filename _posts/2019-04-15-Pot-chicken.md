## step 1:

Question "What is the difference between bowl chicken, stick chicken, string incense, fake dishes, hot pot and cold pot?"As an experienced eater, Jingfeng will give you an answer.~

## step 2:

Hot pot needn't be said, string fragrance is almost like putting on the dish label of the hot pot and then rinsing it. The cold pot string is to soak the string in the red oil soup prepared in advance without heating the stick chicken, that is, pot chicken. It looks very similar to the cold pot string, but the difference is very big.The preferred soup base of Po Chicken is the chicken broth prepared by careful boiling and hot pepper with red oil. The soup base of hot pot bottom is usually used for cold pot string.Secondly, although the cold pot string is a cold pot, in fact, the string will be eaten immediately after lying down and soaking in the cold soup bottom. In fact, the string is hot only when it is eaten, and no longer boiled (which is the difference between the cold pot string and the common string fragrance). However, the potted chicken will cook the string well and soak in the soup bottom until it is cooled and then enjoy it.

## step 3:

Okay, so much to get to the point. ~First, prepare the soup, wash the whole chicken or chicken thighs with blood water, then cold water into the pot, add cooking wine, onion, ginger slices, boil over a big fire and then turn to stew for more than 1 hour. (The longer the stewing time is, the better the chicken can be cooked, the chicken can be removed and left Tu after boiling.

## step 5:

Cooked food is put in cold and dried water and then strung together with bamboo sticks. Don't be too greedy to string too much. It's better to concentrate on the first half of bamboo sticks for easy soaking into soup.
