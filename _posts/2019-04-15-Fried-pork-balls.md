# Introduction

**"When you make dumplings, you have stuffing left. You think about eating steamed vegetables and putting balls. It tastes good. You just make balls. The fillings are a little thinner. You add eggs to make them sticky so that they can be shaped and fried and tasted. It's delicious. You just forget to take pictures and have to make a cover in the pot."**
