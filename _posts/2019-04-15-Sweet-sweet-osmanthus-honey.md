# Steps

## step 1:

The orange is soaked in salt water for 5 minutes, and the surface is rubbed with salt. The same is to wash the wax off the surface of the orange. It can be eaten more healthily and safely. Then it can be drained, or it can be dried with kitchen paper.

## step 2:

Then use a knife to scratch a few knives on the kumquat slightly, but don't cut it off. Cut it into blocks. Then press it down with the knife face perpendicular to the knife edge, and a small flower will come out.

## step 3:

I processed all the oranges into the shape of this little flower, in order to make them taste better when they were cured.

## step 4:

Then we can prepare the cured kumquat. Just like the method of making fruit wine, the order of one layer of kumquat and one layer of sugar is put into the sealed jar one time. The kumquat should be cured for two days, and then refrigerated in the refrigerator. It will be easier to cook, otherwise the fresh kumquat will be difficult to boil soft into the desired kumquat honey.

## step 5:

It's normal for cured kumquat to get some water out, and the pulp will become much softer. I pour it into the pot and prepare it for boiling.

## step 6:

Then add 100g water and 100g sugar to boil.

## step 7:

Because there is more sugar, so in the boiling process, it should be constantly doubled in order to prevent it from sticking to the bottom and boiling until the sugar melts completely, and the juice is almost dry.

## step 8:

Finally, add some dried osmanthus, and mix with orange evenly. It will be more moist after adding osmanthus.

## step 9:

Good oranges can only be put into sealed pots until they are completely cooled. If they are not cooled, there will be a lot of water vapor when they are filled. Afterwards, it will affect the storage time of oranges. Oh by the way sealed pot, remember to boil and disinfect them in advance, drain the water, keep them dry and reuse, and make sure spoons or chopsticks are clean and dry when they are taken.

## step 10:

A good golden orange refrigerator can be kept for a long time. On weekdays, several pieces can be taken out and eaten as preserves.

## step 11:

When it's cold, flush with osmanthus flowers, or moisten the lungs and clear cough, reduce dryness and fire, small partners can drink more.
