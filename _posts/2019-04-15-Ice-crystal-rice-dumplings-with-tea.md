# Tips

1. When crystal powder and water are mixed, they will be sticky at first. They can be cut and mixed slowly with a soft scraper until they become even.2. This time, the vacuum packaging can be used after rinsing. If you buy hard leaves on the market, you need to boil them for five minutes to soften them and reuse them.3. If you don't want to use the cotyledon wrapping of zongkou, you can choose ice crystal zongkou triangle die to wrap directly.4. When the crystal skin is warm and hot, it should be wrapped. If it is too hot and sticky, the adhesion will decrease if it is too cool.5. Prepared crystal zongzi can be refrigerated and eaten again. The taste will be Q-elastic, and will not stick too much to the leaves of zongzi.6. Crystal dumplings can be stored in refrigerators and sealed for 2-3 days. It is recommended that they be eaten as soon as possible.
