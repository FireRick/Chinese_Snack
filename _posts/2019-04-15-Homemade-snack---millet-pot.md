# Tips

1. Millet can be soaked for more than four hours or boiled in a pot for ten minutes. The bun is too soft, or it will become porridge.2. If you want to eat crisp, add an egg and noodles. I don't put any eggs. They are crisp. Add them according to your taste.3. Seasonings can be added cumin or pepper or salt, or only salt to eat the original flavor, according to their own millet with seasoning bar, taste is different, seasoning number of their own.
