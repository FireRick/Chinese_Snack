# Tips

1. The muffin fire is really a small fire all the way. The first time you fry it, you should think about the middle fire, and finally you still feel a little burnt.2. Before doing this, I had read the tutorial on the internet. When it comes to frying until one side of the honeycomb hole is turned over, I've been waiting for A to wait, and then it's fried out!The thickness of each person's cooking is different. Frying until one side of the shaping shovel can be pushed to turn over.
