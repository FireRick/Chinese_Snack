# Introduction

**"Blueberry yam is a very common but rare dish. Every time we eat out, our children will order one. Over time, which blueberry yam has its own characteristics, he is as rare as others.But living at home from the economic and health point of view, it is impossible to eat restaurants regularly, and the hotel blueberry yam cheap 18 yuan, expensive 28 yuan, so a cute, I eat more than a mouthful feel robbed of children.The traditional blueberry yam needs light cream. I think the calorie of light cream is too high. It's not as refreshing as yogurt. So I'll make an improved version of blueberry yam.It tastes sweet and glutinous, and has lower calories.If you don't even have yogurt, you can change it into milk. It's delicious to have a light fragrance of milk.Come and cook with me quickly. It will definitely become a classic dish in your family.**

# Steps

## step 1:

Two iron stick yam are ready, this yam is rich in starch, the taste is soft and waxy after ripening; there is a kind of vegetable yam used for stir-frying, its taste is crisp and tender, not suitable for making blueberry yam puree this dish; when buying, you can ask the merchant;

## step 2:

Put on disposable gloves or put a plastic bag on your hand to scrape off the yam skin. Yam mucus contains mucopolysaccharide, which is sticky and slippery. Although it is good for your health, it will itch on your skin, so try to avoid contact.

## step 3:

Rinse the yam and cut it into sections. Put it in a steamer.

## step 4:

I use a steaming box of 100 degrees, steaming for 10 minutes; ordinary steaming pot, steaming for about 10 minutes after steaming, see the number and height of yam to determine the time, as far as possible, let yam flat in the steaming plate;

## step 5:

Steamed yam is taken out and aired. The original yogurt and a little salt are prepared.

## step 6:

Yam is pressed into delicate yam mud with a mud press. If there is no mud press, yam can be put into a fresh-keeping bag and rolled into delicate mud with a rolling pin.

## step 7:

Add yogurt one by one; why add yogurt one by one?Because the consistency of yam paste can not be predicted, different brands of yoghurt have different consistency.

## step 8:

Mix yogurt, a small amount of salt and yam paste with a spoon to make it as soft as melted ice cream or as large as refined oil; yogurt is sweet and can be added sugar according to its taste; adding a little salt can better set off the fragrance and sweetness;

## step 9:

Put the yam paste into the mounted flower bag and put a large multi-toothed flower mouth in advance. If there is no mounted flower bag and flower mouth, it can be directly dug out by biscuit mold or spoon and put on the plate and patted into shape.

The blueberry sauce is mixed with a proper amount of raw yogurt to form a flowing paste. The blueberry sauce can be steamed when yam is steamed.

# Tips

1. The peeling and steaming of Chinese yam is easier than the steaming with skin, and it won't leave small black spots in the epidermis, so the Chinese yam mud looks more white; using disposable gloves or plastic bags to cover the hands can solve the discomfort caused by the skin sticking to the Chinese yam mucus; 2. Salt can be put or not, if put, only a little, to foil the fragrance and sweetness.
