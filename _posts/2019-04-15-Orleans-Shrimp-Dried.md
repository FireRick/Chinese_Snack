# Introduction

**"Dried shrimp is rich in nutrition, protein is several to dozens of times as much as fish, eggs and milk; it also contains rich minerals such as potassium, iodine, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin A, aminophylline and other ingredients, and its meat is soft and digestible. Dried shrimp is a very good food for people who are weak and need to be nursed after illness. It is also rich in phosphorus, calcium, especially for children and pregnant women.Effectiveness.Every year, I bake some dried shrimps and store them for my children as snacks and for my dad's drinks. When my grandmother was here, she used to treat the dried shrimps as snacks, baked shrimps and rice dried by herself, crispness or control.Usually I bake a little wet for the children and then crisp for the baby's grandmother. The crisp food is suitable for the elderly. It's easy to eat.How to control the dryness and crispness of dried shrimp? I have made dried shrimp for so many years. I think steamed oven is the best way to use it.Steam oven baking can be a tender baking mode, baked in a short time is suitable for children, slightly tough children eat just to practice their teeth.But to the mother-in-law with bad teeth, I will bake crisp and crisp, and bite off the shell meat is super fragrant.Now let's share the dried shrimp baked in a Western steamed oven.This steamed oven comes with a roasted shrimp model, and the one-click cooking method is extremely simple.I bake it once according to the procedure and it's suitable for children.Then the same pattern repeated twice baking is suitable for the mother-in-law.Well, please don't miss it.This Westinghouse 4201A oven is still active now. Friends can trust me if they want to.**
