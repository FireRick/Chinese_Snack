## step 2:

The foamed beans, with 1000 ml water, were beaten three times in the fruit and vegetable mode (after three times, the bean dregs were delicate, and the bean dregs were going to be added to the flour to make steamed buns).

## step 8:

The lactone solution is poured into the soybean milk, stirred evenly, and the foam is removed. (If it is winter, the soybean milk is filtered into another inner gallbladder, it needs to be heated for 30 seconds to one minute, then the lactone solution is poured into the soybean milk. Now the temperature is high in summer, so the soybean milk cooling slowly is not necessary.)
