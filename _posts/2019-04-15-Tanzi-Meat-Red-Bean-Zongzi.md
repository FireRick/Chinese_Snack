# Introduction

**"After wrapping up the rose dumplings, there are still a few leaves of dumplings, just soak some glutinous rice and red beans and make some salty dumplings.Red bean salted rice dumplings, the most classic is bacon and red bean dumplings, but this year, something different, the bacon into jar meat, to a jar meat and bacon dumplings, do not know what is the taste?The jar meat is too fat. If you cut the rice dumplings in accordance with the previous practice, it would appear too fat.Think about it better to slice it into slices, at least slices of lean meat.This is supposed to be the thinnest piece of jar meat, isn't it?It still looks fat.Stir-fry out excess oil, not only to increase the fragrance, but also to eat less oil.Salt addition is entirely based on experience, and without experience, it has to be added at will.At first, the leaves of Zongye rolled in a circle and a half wrapped in long and slender Zongye, the most comfortable and favorite shape.Later, seeing the need for leftovers, wrapped the last two into fat dumplings, there was no leftovers at all.Red bean salted rice dumpling with jar meat tastes as good as bacon version.**
