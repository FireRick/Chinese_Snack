## step 1:

Prepare all kinds of ingredients, chicken breast needs to be thawed in advance, otherwise there will be blisters and soft skin in the roasting process.

## step 2:

Cut the whole piece of chicken breast horizontally from one side, and don't cut off the other side, forming the figure.

## step 3:

Mix salt, cooking wine, raw soy sauce and white pepper. Dip chicken breast into it and marinate for a moment.Because chicken breast meat is delicate and tender, it does not need to hammer and loosen the fibers like beef, and it is easy to taste by rubbing a few times.

## step 4:

Disperse the eggs and prepare the starch, egg juice and bread crumbs in sequence.

## step 5:

Preheat the P5040YE oven, select program 1 (heating up and down at the same time), the upper and lower temperatures are automatically 180 degrees, without manual adjustment, and set the time for 10 minutes.

## step 6:

Breakfast cheese slices are torn into small pieces and sandwiched between chicken breasts.Stuff in the middle as far as possible, not beyond the edge of the chicken, otherwise it will easily flow out when roasting.

## step 7:

Seal the opening with toothpick and roll it in starch first.

## step 8:

Then roll it in the egg juice and bread crumb, shake off the excess and put it on the baking tray.Black baking trays have non-stick coatings, but for easy cleaning, they can be padded with oil paper or tin paper.

## step 9:

Use a brush to put a little vegetable oil on the surface of the chicken chops, so that the color is golden and beautiful, and the taste is good.Place the tray in the middle of the preheated PE5040YE oven. Set the temperature unchanged and bake in hot air for about 15 minutes.Hot air baking can make the oven temperature more consistent, making the surface more crisp.

## step 10:

Remove the toothpick after baking.It can be seen that the whole chicken steak is uniformly colored, and there is no cheese flowing out around, which means that the heating in the oven is uniform and gentle, and there will be no corner warming.
