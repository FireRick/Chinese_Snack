# Tips

1. Drain the water from the potato chips, or they will splash oil when they are fried.Don't put too many potato chips in the pot to avoid sticking together.Potatoes can be fried several times. After they are fried, they can be put together and fried again.2. The fried potato chips still have a lot of oil.It's better than fried.If your baby eats it, it's better to use the oven. Next time, try the oven version of French fries.
