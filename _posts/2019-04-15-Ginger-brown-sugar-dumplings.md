# Tips

1. The amount of food is adjusted according to the number and preference of family members.(I'm the size of two people.) You can buy bagged glutinous rice flour without water-milling glutinous rice flour dough.If you don't like to eat ginger grains, you can filter out the crushed ginger.If you like sweet wine, you can add sweet wine.
