# Introduction

**"A small dish of instant noodles, a small bowl of jar meat - to be exact, fat jar meat, lean meat almost zero, have appeared on the desk.Then there's the idea of putting them together.Just made a green sauce of Scandinavian, can not help but want to make this fat and instant noodles into Scandinavian.Fat is oil, and Scongzhong doesn't need extra oil.Add some onions, add a little onion fragrance, maybe make jar meat more prominent fragrance.The oven is still unavailable, and the electric cake clasp continues on top.This time, there is no preheating, as if the effect of roasting is quite good.The special fragrance of jar meat is mixed with onion.Without extra oil, it's full of oil.Instant noodles can only vaguely see some curved lines on the surface, when they are broken off, they are totally invisible...**
