# Yam Strawberry Dafu

# Introduction

**"Instead of wrapping strawberries with glutinous rice balls, which Dafu traditionally uses, this time I used yam and pumpkin paste, and the outermost layer was covered with scented coconut.Yam invigorates the spleen and stomach, helps digestion, pumpkin can enhance baby's immunity and prevent constipation.Strawberry is known as the "queen of fruits" which contains a lot of vitamin C and carotene and other nutrients, and has an important impact on the development of the baby's brain and intelligence.**
