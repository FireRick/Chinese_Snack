# Steps

## step 1:

First, wash the potatoes, shave off the skin with a planer, and then wash them again.

## step 2:

Cut the potatoes into even slices, try to cut them thinner and more evenly, and the fried potatoes will be more delicious. Here I cut them horizontally and vertically, so that we can cut the shape of the holes and fry them more evenly. You can also try this.

## step 3:

Cut potato chips over water, pour in a small amount of white vinegar, let it soak for 10 minutes, so that the starch can bubble slightly, and then rinse the starch off the surface.

## step 4:

The washed potato chips are filtered out and drained for later use.

## step 5:

Then prepare a pot, add appropriate amount of cooking oil, heat to the cooking oil slightly boiling, there are small bubbles can be.

## step 6:

Then you can put the potato chips directly into the pot and fry them for the first time and cook them.

## step 7:

After about 3 minutes of frying, the potato chips turn slightly yellow or soft. Remove them.

## step 8:

Then deep-fry the potato chips in the minimum heat for the second time. This time, we need to pay attention to the temperature. The oil temperature reaches 170 degrees and then goes into the pot. The oil is boiling. You must pay attention not to fry the potato chips.

## step 9:

Maybe you can get it out of this golden crisp state, or you'll blow it up.

## step 10:

Fried potato chips can be seasoned with a small amount of salt, cumin powder or whatever, spicy or spicy flavor can also be seasoned with some chili powder, it should be more refreshing to eat.

# Tips

1. Must be divided into several times, a small amount of fried, because if too many potato chips directly into the pot, the oil temperature is not enough.2. When frying, the minimum heat must be used. When frying the second time, the oil temperature should be about 170 degrees. If the temperature is too low, it will not be crisp enough. If the potato chips are sliced thickly, the oil temperature can be increased by 20 degrees.3. Must add vinegar to soak for more than 10 minutes to enhance the role of pectin and make starch spill over quickly.More recipes and videos can focus on my public number: Little Devil Kitchen can also focus on micro-blog: Makaron Little Devil Woman will be released from time to time.
