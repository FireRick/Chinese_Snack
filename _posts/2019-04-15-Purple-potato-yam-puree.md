# Introduction

**"Zinc, iron, copper, manganese, calcium and selenium in purple potato are all natural, and the content of iron and calcium is very high.Yam is a good helper in preventing and curing diarrhea. Yam is a tonic for Qi, which has the function of Tonifying the spleen and stomach.Usually, purple potatoes and yam are steamed and eaten separately, but the eating method is too monotonous and the taste is not so good, so we combine purple potatoes and yam. In order to let children eat better, I make purple potatoes and yam into mud, and then use a mold to shape, so it is easier to accept.**
