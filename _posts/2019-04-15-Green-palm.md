# Introduction

**"Brown is the preferred food for Dragon Boat Festival (family especially like to eat brown, so they often pack it). Because the Dragon Boat Festival is not able to pack brown when traveling outside, the fresh brown leaves bought before are frozen in the refrigerator. The fresh brown leaves are green, but the leaves are narrow and the wrapped effect is very bright and beautiful. (Each time I wrap two kinds: one kind of jujube, one kind of kidney beans, this time only wrapped kidney beans that children like to eat.The glutinous rice brown was baked all night last night. The taste of glutinous rice is clear and the fragrance of Brown is rich.**

# Steps

## step 1:

Wash the brown leaves repeatedly and cook them in a pot for 15 minutes.

## step 2:

Rinse glutinous rice with pure water for at least 2 hours before rinsing.

## step 3:

Rinse and soak the kidney beans for several hours (change water halfway). Cook the brown leaves and wash them for cool water.

## step 4:

Because the brown leaves are slightly narrow, each Brown is laid out with three brown leaves and staggered layers. First, add glutinous rice and kidney beans, then add a layer of glutinous rice, close the mouth and tie the rope, and cut off the redundant brown leaves. It looks beautiful (by analogy, play a contiguous role in each other). The wrapped Browns are neat and beautiful (because the family is not off work, double wrappers can not take photos of the wrapping process, presumably everyone will do it).

## step 5:

The wrapped brown horse is green and green. It's beautiful.

## step 6:

Because the leaves of fresh brown leaves are narrower, each Brown is wrapped up with three pieces smaller than the normal big brown leaves (boiling time is relatively less).

## step 7:

First put the wrapped Browns into the pot and cross each other tightly. Then add cold water (the pure water I added) and boil them over a small fire.

## step 8:

Boil over low heat for 40 minutes (because the brown is smaller, the big brown is boiled for 1 hour) because it was boiled at 9 o'clock yesterday, and it tastes good (tough).

## step 9:

This morning, the cooked brown will be taken out for cold water. The finished product is still very beautiful, appetite is good, taste a mouthful full of elasticity, layered, tough and glutinous food, rich in brown fragrance.
