# Introduction

**"When I was a child, I wanted to eat baked sweet potatoes, but at home I could only bake potatoes. Now I want to eat sweet potato forks, but I only sell potato forks. I can only make one by myself. When I steamed it, I mixed a bowl for my roommate first. As a result, my own bowl has not yet been mixed with her CD-ROM.**

## step 3:

The two sweet potatoes were all wiped into silk totaling 310G (afraid of hurting their hands, the last remaining hard-to-wipe sweet potato heads were boiled and eaten). The shredded sweet potatoes were drier, so they were washed with water once.

## step 4:

Drained sweet potato shredded water (there is no water residue at the bottom of the bowl), transfer to a large basin, mix flour, flour should not be added in one time, while mixing, according to the degree of water absorption of sweet potatoes, the added flour weight is different, mix each sweet potato shredded surface with flour and do not adhere to each other on the line.

# Tips

1. The above is for two persons; 2. When mixing, you can mix it according to your own preferences. You can add vinegar, raw soy sauce, garlic paste and so on.3. I use spiral pepper is more spicy, do not like to eat spicy pepper can be replaced by other peppers.
