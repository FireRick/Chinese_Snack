# Tips

1. The key to this pastry is the moisture content of the dough. Egg liquid can be added as appropriate until the dough can be kneaded into small balls that are not easy to disperse.But it is not advisable to add too much, otherwise it is not easy to roast through, making the balls hard and affecting the taste.2. When the energy ball is baked, the color does not change much. Pay attention to the temperature and do not bake it.3. Cooled energy ball is slightly hard and brittle taste, if the inside of the energy ball is wet and soft, it is not baked through, to extend the time.
