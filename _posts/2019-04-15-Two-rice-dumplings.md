# Introduction

**"Black and white glutinous rice match, just like Yin and Yang, so it has the name of"two instruments".As soon as I saw this dumpling, I immediately thought that there seemed to be a bag of black glutinous rice, and I really found it.Take advantage of the Dragon Boat Festival, start at once.Although there is no eyebrow beans, you can also not use them. When you think of many rose sauces, you simply use roses instead.It's not so complicated to make zongzi, but it takes a lot of time to soak beans and rice.The volume of black glutinous rice seems larger than that of white glutinous rice, and the same weight looks more than that of white glutinous rice, which makes people wonder if it is the wrong weight.Soaking for a long time and cooking for a long time, zongzi always seems to be particularly time-consuming.And eating is always happy, just like revealing the truth, opening dumplings is always full of expectations and curiosity.Dumplings of two instruments, black and white, taste slightly sweet, after cooling, the granularity of black glutinous rice is very obvious.Originally, black glutinous rice is not so easy to boil to rotten, perhaps, it should be boiled in advance.However, this granular feeling seems to be good, biting in the mouth, feeling like...Fish seed?....**
