# Steps

## step 1:

Prepare the ingredients, bake the peanuts in the oven 160 degrees in advance for 18 to 20 minutes (I bake a whole dish for 18 minutes, and if I bake half a dish for 10 minutes, it's almost ripe). After baking, peel off the skin, then roll a little with a rolling pin, and chop the cranberries.

## step 2:

Add butter to the non-stick pan and burn it over a low heat until the butter is melted. (Make sure you don't use the non-stick pan!Otherwise, sugar will stick to the pot everywhere. It's troublesome!).

## step 9:

Put a layer of oil paper on it, then use a rolling stick or hand to flatten it, then put it in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes (or put it in the refrigerator for half an hour, or let it cool and harden naturally at room temperature).

# Tips

If you want hard candy, you can cook cotton candy a little longer, so that the rolled candy will be harder.
