# Steps

## step 1:

Prepare mutton, chili powder, cumin and salt.Mutton fat or lean according to their own taste.

## step 2:

Wash mutton clean, drain water, cut into small pieces, not too big, otherwise it is not easy to ripen.

## step 3:

Cut the pieces and mix them with a spoonful of salt.

## step 4:

When salt is mixed, it can be put into a string directly without waiting for flavor, because the meat is very small.

## step 5:

The oven is preheated at 210 degrees, the baking tray is covered with tinfoil, the mutton kebabs are put on the middle of the oven, and baked for 10 minutes (or directly on the baking net, but the next thing is to put tinfoil on the baking tray mat, so as to catch the baked blood and oil, and also to facilitate cleaning).

## step 6:

Because there is water and oil in the baking tray, turn the mutton kebabs over and put them on the baking net. The baking tray is also put under. Tin paper need not be removed in order to bake the oil next.Continue baking at 210 degrees for 5 minutes.(The rest is wasteful, so I put some sausages together to bake).

## step 7:

After baking, take it out and put it on a plate. Sprinkle it with chili powder and cumin.
