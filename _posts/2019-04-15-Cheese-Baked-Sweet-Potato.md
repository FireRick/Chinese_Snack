# Tips

1. Selection of sweet potatoes: The sweet potatoes should be as fat and round as possible, so that they can be deep enough as containers and filled with mashed potatoes.Do not choose to steamed sweet potatoes too soft texture, or the shell may not support the weight of mashed potatoes.2. Butter and milk: If you don't like butter, you can replace butter and milk with butter.Sweet potatoes of different sizes have different amounts of milk.90 g in the formula is the reference value, not to add all, the exact dosage depends on the state of the mashed potatoes, as long as the mashed potatoes are not loose.3. Tools: No oven can be replaced by a pan. Tin paper on the bottom of the pan and sweet potatoes filled with stuffing and cheese are put into the pan. Put a little water on the bottom of the pan, cover the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cheese can be melted and eaten.
