# Tips

1. The pot stickers are exquisite. We should stick the bottom pot with a pan and apply a layer of oil slightly. The pot stickers should be arranged neatly one by one. When frying, we should sprinkle some water evenly. It is better to sprinkle water with a small spout in the pot sticker gap to make it infiltrate into the bottom of the pan.Cover the pan and fry for two or three minutes. Sprinkle water again.Pan-fry for another two or three minutes and sprinkle again.A little oil can be sprayed at this time.2. Many people can't tell the difference between potstickers and fried dumplings. They think that they are the same. In some places, potstickers are even called fried dumplings. But in fact, there are essential differences between the two methods of making potstickers.The biggest difference between fried dumplings and potstickers is that fried dumplings need to be fried before boiling, or boiled before frying. In a word, boiling process is indispensable (in fact, in many places, fried dumplings are fried directly without boiling process).And dumpling is a success of covering the pot cover once, and the pot sticker can only be fried, must not add water boiling, during the need to constantly rotate the pot and uncover the lid of the pot, which is the biggest difference between dumpling and pot sticker.
