# Steps

## step 1:

First, the salted cherry blossoms are soaked in water about 40 degrees, then the container is big enough. Then, when desalination is done, the cherry blossom clip or chopsticks are used to hold the flower handle gently and shake it back and forth. Then, the water is changed every other time. If the cherry blossoms are soaked in water about 3-5 times, it will save time to soak them directly in warm water.
