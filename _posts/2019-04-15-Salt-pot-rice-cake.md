## step 4:

Spray a small amount of water on the oil paper (to prevent the sticking of rice and oil paper), spread the prepared rice on the oil paper, cover the rice with a fresh-keeping film, and roll it flat and thin with a rolling pin (thin and even, if not out of the pot, it will lead to hard edges, soft in the middle).
