# Tips

1. The meat paste will not crack until it is stirred and roasted.2. Meat paste should be rolled evenly and not too thick. Otherwise, thin areas are easy to scorch, too thick is not delicious.3. Too many colors will turn black.4. Oven temperature is different, adjust and adjust when necessary.5. It should be a little soft when it comes out of the oven. If it's dried, it will become very hard and tasteless after airing.
