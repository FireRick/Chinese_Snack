# Introduction

**"As a northern sister, after she came to Wuhan, she liked all kinds of delicacies here, of course, there are also dislikes to eat, especially all kinds of rice products. A bowl of beef and rice flour or original soup rice flour for breakfast is more attractive to me than hot-dried noodles. Those rice cakes, rice cake, sticky rice cake, fried in oil, and then dripped with brown sugar are bought every time I see them.Juice is also super delicious, the world of food to see the favorite food is two eyes shining.On the streets of Wuhan, there are occasionally small dining cars selling sugar and oil bamboo. The shell of fried sugar and oil bamboo is crisp and sweet. For 3-5 yuan, buy a bunch of decomposition bamboo. It seems that Changsha, Hunan Province, is more representative of sugar and oil bamboo. In fact, as a neighboring province of Hubei, the diet is almost the same. When bamboo is made at home, the family version of sugar and oil bamboo is not all made with brown sugar, put in a certain proportion.White sugar and honey, fried sugar and oil bamboo charcoal has bright color, sweet but not greasy, very delicious.**

# Tips

1. The glutinous rice flour dough should be softer. If it is too dry, it will spread out when pressed into small cakes.2. Sugar water in it will be too dark if all brown sugar is used. Adding a certain proportion of sugar and honey not only tastes good, but also has beautiful color.
