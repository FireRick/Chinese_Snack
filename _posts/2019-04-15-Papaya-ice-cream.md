# Tips

1. It's delicious to make ice-cream without butter. The taste is not bad at all.2. No wall breaker can be replaced by a material machine or a material stick.3. Ice cakes are frozen, and good demoulding is the key. It is suggested that we should try our best to buy a silica gel mould with a cover for super good demoulding.
