# Tips

1. Without highly refined brown sugar, almost all the ingredients in sugarcane juice are retained. Its vitamins, trace elements and nutrients are much higher than those of ordinary sugar, and it has a unique flavor similar to caramel, which is very suitable for making desserts.2. The pure brown sugar of the sweet juice garden I used is of good color, no impurities and full taste. Besides, there are self-sealing strips on the bags. After opening the bags, there is no need to worry about dampness, which is very convenient.3. Xiancao itself has no sweetness. It should be eaten with brown syrup.This recipe is moderately sweet and delicious.
