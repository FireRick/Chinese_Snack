# Introduction

**"I remember a steak ordered at Rome's Red Lobster Restaurant with roast corn. The corn tasted delicious and tasted like a steak dressing, like Grill Mates Steak Rub. Imagine it and put it into action. So I used a microwave oven for frozen corn.Steak Rub is coated after turning to cook, and fried in a pan. The fragrance is drifting all over the kitchen.Since buying the air cooker, always thinking about how to "widely" use, think of roast corn, it really works, since then there is a kind of food called air cooker.**

## step 2:

Put the corn on the board and roll it hard so that the corn grains can stick up the seasoning on average.

## step 3:

Spray or spray a layer of vegetable oil on the bottom of the air pan. Roast the corn kernels upward at 380 degrees F for 5 minutes before checking whether the corn is golden brown. If it is not hot enough, continue to bake for 2 to 3 minutes, then stop the machine to observe. Anyway, bake until you are full of scorch, but don't overcook.

# Tips

Steak Rub has many kinds. This time I use Canadians. I used several American condiments before. They are all good. If Steak Rub is not available, you can add black pepper and garlic salt, onion powder or Seasoning Salt. There is no problem with Chicken Seasoning. You can choose the one that tastes good. It is estimated that there are similar condiments in steak, chicken steak and pork steak in China.Material, domestic friends can also try.
