**"Sandwiches are really fast-handed and highly inclusive food.Between the two pieces of toast, meat and vegetable with jam, cocoa, salty and sweet, Chinese Western style, whatever you want, you can have a dark one, with stinky tofu, with preserved eggs, with herring cans, oh my ~But the traditional sandwich is too monotonous, that is, the toast slices with food materials, "buzz", grinding the knife, along the diagonal line of the toast slices.Cut, Nah, a perfect triangle was born.This time I decided to change the shape of the dish, using lettuce, eggs, tomato sauce, and Jenny Jean's new flying fish sausage, which tastes sweet. My favorite dish is the fish seed inside. The golden fish seed bitten from time to time bursts in my mouth. Using the Japanese hand roll as a reference, I spread all the dishes on toast slices, roll lightly, oven."Ding" inside, Just smelling the fragrance floating out of people's index finger big move.Give it a try.**
