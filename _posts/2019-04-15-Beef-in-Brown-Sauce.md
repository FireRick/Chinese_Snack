## step 6:

If you don't use a pressure cooker, it will boil for a long time. You can boil the beef in a big fire and then turn to a small one to stew slowly. The sign of cooking is to prick it with a chopstick. If it pricks thoroughly at once, it means that the beef has been stewed, otherwise it will continue to stew until it is ripe.
