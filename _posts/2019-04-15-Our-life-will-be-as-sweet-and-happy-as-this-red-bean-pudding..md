Red beans are soaked in advance and boiled for about 40 minutes. We have to mention this new type of rice pot. It is very suitable for beans, double-layer pot body, double-layer cover. It has excellent heat storage function. The effect of boiling beans is comparable to that of high-pressure pot, but the taste is not comparable to that of high-pressure pot.
