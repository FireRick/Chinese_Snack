Steamed glutinous rice jujube is very soft and delicious. When the lid of the pot is uncovered, the aroma of red jujube comes with warm water vapor. It's really very happy in winter.

## step 11:

The glutinous rice jujube is red and white, which is very beautiful. Because the hard core has been removed and the glutinous rice ball has been replaced, we have also given it a special inflammatory name, called "heart is too soft", which is also the image of real.One mouthful goes on, the first thing to eat is the unique sweet jujube, after chewing slowly, there will be soft glutinous rice teeth, the more delicious it is.
