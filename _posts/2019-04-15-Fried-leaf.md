# Tips

The noodles of hemp leaves should be harder, so that they are easy to roll thin;. Small fires must be used to fry them on both sides, so that they will not be fried; _. After cooling, they can be stored in a sealed tank for about half a month; small bubbles will appear when fried, because there are eggs in the noodles, which can be filtered;
