# Steps

## step 1:

Whole wheat flour is mixed with a proper amount of boiling water to warm the noodles and knead into dough. This time, I used full-boiled noodles, which are soft, and then covered with fresh-keeping film.This flour is Russian wholemeal flour from a good friend. It's called a black. No wonder it's so black in Russia, but it smells like wheat.

# Tips

1. The difference between this leek egg box and the usual leek egg filling is that the eggs do not need to be fried in advance, and do not need to be dispersed. The branded box contains a complete egg cake.2. This box is larger than the usual leek egg box, so as to avoid the egg juice flowing out of the pancake.3. The ironing cake is soft, not strong, and can be chosen according to personal preferences and noodles.
