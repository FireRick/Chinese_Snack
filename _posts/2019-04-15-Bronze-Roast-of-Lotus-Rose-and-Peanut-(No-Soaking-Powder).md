1. The filling of the sandwich can be changed into different fillings such as red bean paste, pumpkin paste, banana paste, meat pine, jam and so on.2. It tastes and tastes best when it's hot.3. Bronze gongs are fried in non-stick pans without oil. Otherwise, the pancake skins will not be smooth.4. When frying the gong, we should master the temperature well, otherwise the color will probably come out unevenly.Fry one piece at a time and gently sweep the surface of the pan with a brush to avoid the burnt powder sticking to the next piece of cake.
