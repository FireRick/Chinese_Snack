# Introduction

**"Yogurt-soluble beans are a finger food that mothers want to make in the history of complementary food.It's also the most frequent failure in the history of complementary food. I started to do it in 7 or 8 months. I just made a pool of water samples. I did it two times in a row. I slowly changed milk powder, cornstarch and many prescriptions.Beans are shaped, but they don't have water chestnuts.Later, he gave up making yoghurt beans temporarily. He first made pitaya beans and pumpkin beans, and found a surprising success.After summing up the experience of many failures and then making yogurt beans, we finally made instant yogurt beans. Later, we used this formula every time without failing.**

## step 2:

Preparations: put the flower mouth into the mounting bag and cover the bottle mouth; spread baking paper or silica gel pad on the baking tray; and use the electric egg beater, the silica gel shovel is ready.

## step 3:

Place the egg white in an oil-free bowl, cover with a fresh-keeping film, and freeze for 10 minutes.It's best to freeze together with a basin. If the refrigerator is not big enough, put it in a small bowl and then enlarge the bowl/basin.Place the egg white in a small bowl before pouring it back into a large bowl.Avoid eggs spoiling easily in summer. Egg yolk is mixed with protein.

## step 4:

The milk powder is added to the thick yogurt, and the powder can not be seen when stirred.

## step 5:

Pour the lemon juice into the protein, whip the protein at high speed, turn off the beater halfway, lift it up and see, the protein with curved corners continue to beat, scrape in the edge protein, until there are short and straight sharp corners.Be sure to hit short and straight sharp corners, and don't beat any more. The thicker the beating, the cracks will appear in the soluble beans.

## step 6:

Pour cornstarch in, stir in the beater for 3 seconds, and scrape in the edge cream with a scraper.

## step 7:

Preheat the oven 100 degrees.Scrape 1/3 protein cream into yogurt, cut and mix evenly.

![step 7]({{site.baseurl}}/img/407415/7.jpg)

## step 8:

Mix the yogurt protein back into the protein cream, slightly cut and mix evenly.Cut and mix while turning the pot. A few times is enough. Don't mix all the time. The thinner the mixing, the thinner the mixing.

## step 9:

Pour yogurt protein cream into the mounting bag and tighten it.

## step 10:

Squeezing Posture: Hold the upper end of the mounting bag with the right hand, and hold the mouth of the mounting bag with the left hand. The whole mounting bag is vertical to the baking pan.Squeeze into the oven 90-100 degrees, 1 hour.It can be easily removed from the oven without sticking the bottom.

## step 11:

Out of the oven, immediately removed one by one, all removed, and then cooled down, sealed in a sealed tank for preservation.It's better to pour a few when you eat, and then pour after you finish.Leave it open and put it in the air. It will be soft in 10 minutes.When it's soft, it needs to be baked at 100 degrees for another 20 minutes.

# Tips

Yoghurt: Must be thick yoghurt, homemade or old yoghurt on the market can be digged with a spoon yoghurt.Others use thin yogurt and hang it on gauze. The yogurt is filtered out, leaving only thick yogurt.Milk powder: infant milk powder can be used for 1 or 2 segments, and skim milk powder for adults can also be successful (try not to use, not suitable for children to eat).The rest of the milk powder is instant and defoams badly.Corn starch: Carrefour Eagle cornmeal (many people think that this kind of corn starch has a high success rate in dissolving beans).Egg white: Make 2 or 3 eggs at a time. Weigh the weight of the egg white and calculate the weight of other ingredients in proportion.The frozen egg white whipped out a more stable protein cream.Sugar: No sugar, the children do not need to eat dissolved beans with sugar, the original taste is very fond of.Lemon juice: Increase the stability of protein cream, but also to remove the smell of eggs.No sugar, lemon juice must be.It can be replaced by white vinegar.Flower mouth: 5 teeth, 6 teeth, 8 teeth, cherry mouth, too.The more teeth I use, the less obvious the pattern may be.
