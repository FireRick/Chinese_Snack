# Tips

1. The best choice of rice is soft and waxy, which tastes better, try not to choose the kind of rice that tastes a little dry, will affect the taste of the pot.2. If you don't have an oven at home, don't worry, you can also make delicious pots.Without an oven, it can be frozen and fried in a frying pan. It tastes more crisp, but maybe a little more fat.3. If you can eat spicy food, it is suggested to touch another layer of chili sauce halfway, so that the taste is more intense.4. If you want to eat salty and sweet food, you can mix it with sauce and honey, then smear it on the pan and fry it in the oven or oil pan.
