# Introduction

**"Many people think that this cake has pumpkins, but in fact it is not. I added fruit - persimmon. Didn't it surprise me?The persimmon in Guangdong is flat, crisp and hard, and it tastes a little astringent, so I have always been reluctant to eat persimmons.But since last year I met a friend from Fuping, Shaanxi Province, who picked fresh Fuping persimmons from the orchard and sent them to me, I have greatly improved persimmons. The original persimmons can be so delicious. The flesh is orange and orange yellow, the flesh is soft and sweet, the juice is rich, and the fiber is few and seedless.The local people make persimmon with this kind of sharp persimmon, which is very popular.I don't have the conditions to make that kind of persimmon cake with white frost, but I wonder if I can make pancakes with persimmon pulp instead of water and noodles.Because it was the first attempt and didn't want to waste material, I made only a few pancakes.Unexpectedly, the pancakes made with persimmon pulp and noodles are soft, waxy and sweet. Although there is no sugar in the mouth, the pulp itself is sweet and delicious.**
