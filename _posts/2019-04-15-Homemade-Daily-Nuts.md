# Introduction

**"Nuts are very popular everyday, all kinds of brands make nuts everyday. Some famous manufacturers of melon seeds also put them on the shelves. Once they saw a little sister drying the nuts she bought everyday. It was said that she bought a catty for more than ten yuan. When they were opened, they were all beans mixed with several cashew nuts. How could they be called nuts?It happens that there are several kinds of nuts at home, washed, sun-dried, baked and packed, which are much better than the daily nuts bought.As the saying goes, eating three jujubes a day keeps me young. I have three jujubes in my nuts.Make 7 small bags at a time, just one week's weight. The formula of Miss Huahua has been changed according to Miss Huahua's recipe.**
