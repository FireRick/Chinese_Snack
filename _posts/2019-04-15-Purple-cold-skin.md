# Tips

After washing the gluten, when the wheat starch paste stays for a long time, it will be slightly acidic. If it stays for a short time, it will be slightly thinner. It will be added with black rice water, which is even thinner, so it has to be thickened by adding corn starch.When the cold paste is transferred to the chopsticks, when the paste flows downstream in a straight line, the paste has just the right consistency. This kind of paste can be used to make cold paste, rice peel, pancakes and so on.
