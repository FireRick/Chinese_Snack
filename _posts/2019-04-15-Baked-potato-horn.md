# Introduction

**"There's nothing to do in the evening to catch up with a play and get some snacks, so I started making this, a snack related to potatoes.Potatoes have always been a favorite food, no matter how delicious they are, fried to eat.Steaming, steaming and so on.And the benefits of potatoes are really many, potatoes are rich in B vitamins, eat can resist aging, make people young and beautiful.The benefits of potatoes go beyond that. When they stay in the human stomach for a relatively long time, they can make people feel fuller for a longer time. Is it possible to eat less so as to lose weight and become thinner and thinner?Haha, it seems that this potato is also a dieter should eat more.**
