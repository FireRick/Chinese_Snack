# Steps

## step 1:

Taro steamed in pot, I did not buy Lipu taro, using the most common taro on the market, feeling that the taro round made is very good.

## step 2:

Steamed taro peeled and put in a basin (weigh).

## step 3:

Press cooked taro into mud with fork or spoon. Slowly add sweet potato starch until hands are not hot. Grab the powder into the taro mud as you add it.The amount of sweet potato starch is 35% to 50% of taro. That is to say, if the peeled taro is 100 grams after steaming, the sweet potato starch will be enlarged by about 35-50 grams, which makes taro round not only retain the taste of taro, but also springy teeth, but also not too Q-bullet.If taro is too dry, add a little warm water.

## step 4:

Add flour bit by bit, knead it in bit by bit, and finally knead it into a non-sticky dough.

## step 5:

Knead into thin strips, cut into small pieces, taro round is ready.

## step 6:

Cut the pumpkin into pieces and steamed in the top drawer.

## step 7:

Chopsticks are ripe if they can be poked through with a single poke.

## step 8:

The steamed pumpkin is very soft. It's scraped off the skin with a spoon.

## step 9:

Stir-fry pumpkin paste in a frying pan to dry it.

![step 9]({{site.baseurl}}/img/351258/9.jpg)

## step 10:

Because the steamed pumpkin has a lot of moisture and wet texture, if you add powder directly, you will need to add a lot of powder to knead to the non-sticky hand state. If you add too much powder, the final round is too Q-elastic, so you should first fry the water and then mix the powder to knead into the non-sticky hand dough.

## step 11:

Knead into a dough that can be rubbed without sticking to the hands. Knead into long strips and cut into pieces.Pumpkin round is also ready.

## step 12:

After boiling with water, put taro balls into the pot and push them open with a spatula so that they will not stick together.When the water boils again, the taro balls float and boil for 1 to 2 minutes.

## step 13:

Pick it up and cool it with cold boiling water.

![step 13]({{site.baseurl}}/img/351258/13.jpg)

## step 14:

It's good to put it in a bowl and eat it directly with sugar and water.I added baked celestial grass jelly, red bean soup, and finally poured some condensed milk.

# Tips

1. Authentic Taiwanese taro is made of sweet potato starch (also known as gourd starch). If not, cassava starch can also be used. The taste of cassava powder is more Q.2. I don't recommend adding sugar to flour and knead noodles, because it will increase the humidity of the material and have to add too much starch to affect the taste.3. If you can't finish eating taro balls at one time, don't boil them. Sprinkle some cornstarch to prevent sticking. Store them in the refrigerator and cook them as you like.
