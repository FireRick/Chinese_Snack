# Introduction

**"Big sister to the door loves our Niu Dabao very much. If there is anything delicious or Dabao likes to eat in it, she will always bring it out for Dabao to eat.A few days ago, I brought another huge dumpling. My eldest sister said steaming or frying is OK. Anyway, your cow Dabao likes it.After thanking my elder sister, I was wondering how to heat it up for Dabao.Later, I think I'd better ask the boy.When Dabao came back in the evening and asked him, the boy said that he hadn't eaten dumplings dipped in brown sugar for a long time. It's better to fry them and dip them in sugar again.It's a good kid who hasn't eaten at home for a while. It's still such a delicious skill.As you said, fry it and dip it in again, so I wrapped it in egg liquid, and then fry it in a multi-purpose pot over a slow fire. It's very fragrant.**
