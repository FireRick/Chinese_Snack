# Tips

1. When baking sausage, put a layer of tin foil paper under it, so that when the foil is baked and thrown away, the frying basket does not need to be cleaned; 2. Sausage must be put on the cheese slices while it is hot, so as to produce the effect of pulping easily; 3. It tastes good when it is hot.
