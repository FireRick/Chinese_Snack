# Tips

/ Material/1. Nuts and dried fruits in the material can be added according to personal preferences.2. Kernels need to be baked with oatmeal in the process of making, while dried fruits need not. Therefore, dried fruits are added after the oatmeal is baked, and can be heated at a later temperature.3. Corn flakes, which are easy to be overbaked and damp, need to be added after all materials are cooled.It can't be added when the food is still hot. Water vapor may be produced during the cooling process, which softens the cornflakes./ Taste/1. The oatmeal in the video is added with cinnamon powder. The light spice flavor improves the taste level.2. If you want to make tea or cocoa taste, you can use the same amount of cinnamon powder instead.
