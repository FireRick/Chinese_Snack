# Introduction

**"Baby loves colorful vegetable cubes. They are not only very bright in color, but also soft and smooth in taste. Every time the baby doesn't like to eat food, they make this for him. How can the baby eat several pieces?This time Xiaofang is not the same as usual. I add rice to it to enhance the feeling of satiety.This can be used as snacks or extra meals for the baby to eat, can also take out, not afraid of the baby along the way hungry.Here, Xiaofang is solidified by eggs. It tastes very soft and tender. Some taste like milk Xiaofang, which can melt after a sip.If the baby is allergic to eggs, change the eggs into water and add 5 grams of lotus root powder or horseshoe powder to solidify them.**

## step 3:

Put a piece of grease paper at the bottom of the bowl and pour all the mud into it.There is some foam on the surface. Never mind. Steamed well, it's gone.Tips: There is no oil paper at the bottom of the bowl. Brushing a layer of oil is also conducive to demoulding, but the effect is certainly better.
