## step 2:

Put it in the microwave oven and heat it for 4 minutes (I heated it for 2 minutes first, stirred it, then heated it for 2 minutes, so it is not easy to paste, and heated evenly). Stir-fry it in a frying pan, too.

## step 3:

When you take it out of the microwave oven, you can see that the red clothes burst open and the leather rubs off with your hands.
