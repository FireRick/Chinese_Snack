# Tips

1. Egg liquid should be wrapped evenly, bread crumb should be compacted and the shell should be fried out to look good.2. The color of gold bread crumb is golden in itself, so when frying, we should pay attention not to burn it.3. The size of squid determines the size of squid circle. Don't buy too small squid when selecting, otherwise the circle is not obvious.
