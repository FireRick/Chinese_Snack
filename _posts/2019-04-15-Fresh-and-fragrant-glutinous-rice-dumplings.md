# Introduction

**"This kind of glutinous rice dumpling is similar to dew dumpling made in the past. The difference lies in boiling, steaming, rolling, soft glutinous rice dumpling wrapped with head vegetables, minced meat, agaric fungus, mushrooms, carrots and other mixed ingredients. It is salty and slightly sour and tastes very unique. It is richer than eating ordinary sweet glutinous rice dumpling."**
