Knead the flour into a soft, non-sticky dough. Make sure that the unused dough is wrapped in a fresh-keeping film and exposed to air for a long time. The surface of the dough will be dry and cracked./ Taste/1. Tea powder and purple potato powder can be added as personal preferences.2. Lotus root powder soup is tasteless. When eating, sweet osmanthus or honey can be added to increase the sweetness.
