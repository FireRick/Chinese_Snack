# Introduction

**"The children came to my home and loved sweet corn cauldron best. It happened that there were fresh cooked tender corn at home. I haven't eaten it for a long time, so I solved the problem together.So immediately start, first make a pot branding when snacks, hands-on operation, found that only corn starch at home, feel the viscosity of corn starch is slightly worse, go out to buy potato starch delays, try to add a little more starch to see, did not expect to enter the pot to find that starch viscosity is not enough, no perfect shape, the edge has been scattered, and can not be re-processed.So directly break the pan, add cheese and sugar to stir-fry, unexpectedly, this little mistake actually stir-fry a unique flavor snack, children rush to eat.**

## step 1:

Peel the tender corn and cook it in a pressure cooker. Remove and cool it for later use.

## step 4:

Add dry starch.

## step 5:

Mix well, let each corn grain be covered with starch, leave some margin when adding starch, pay attention to observation, because the size of corn is different, the number of corn grains is different, if you feel there is no starch, add some starch, saturated do not add.

## step 6:

Add half a bowl of oil into the pot, cook and pour out. Leave a small amount of oil in the pot. Turn to a small fire and pour in the blended corn grains. Flatten them gently and fry them for 3-5 minutes. The corn grains stick together to form a lump.

## step 7:

Normally this step is to pour in the cooked oil just poured out, before the corn kernels, turn to medium heat and raise the temperature, fry for 3 minutes until the corn kernels are golden and crisp.However, it is obvious that the corn kernels near the pot are not adhering well, which may also have something to do with the pot I chose. The pan is still too big. Fortunately, it has not formed, otherwise there is no suitable dish.In the past, we used to use frying pan to make two corn kernels. Today, we do a little more. Turn it over and see, it's broken.

## step 8:

Directly crush it with a wooden shovel, add some oil to stir-fry until the corns are crisp, add 1-2 pieces of milk to stir-fry.

## step 9:

Stir-fry it evenly with a little sugar. It doesn't matter whether the sugar melts or not. Just stick it together. Without sugar, I tasted delicious, but children like sweet or add a little less.

## step 10:

The pot is discharged and the plate is loaded.
