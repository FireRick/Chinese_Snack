# Introduction

**"Faba beans can be used as medicine all over the body.Faba bean coat, broad bean leaf, broad bean flower and broad bean grain have different pharmacodynamics.Vicia faba seed has the functions of invigorating spleen, dampness and reducing blood lipid.Vicia faba contains protein, a small amount of fat and a large number of carbohydrates, in addition to vitamin B, B2.Fresh and tender broad bean is used to make different flavors of dishes, while dried broad bean is mostly used for deep processing, making a variety of snacks, but also made into sauces. Sichuan's famous Pixian bean paste is made by fermentation of dried broad bean.During the National Day, my mother went back home to visit her parents. She soaked a pot of broad beans and said she wanted to make grasshopper beans for my son's snacks. She immediately remembered that although she was short of material when she was young, her mother often tried to make some snacks to relieve our brothers and sisters'hunger.Now in retrospect, I haven't eaten any snacks made by my mother for many years. I miss them very much.Today, following the steps in memory, I made this grasshopper bean which can be used as a snack as well as a wine dish.**
