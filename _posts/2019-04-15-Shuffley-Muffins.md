# Introduction

**"Shuffley muffin is a super soft dessert.It's not so much a cake as a cake. It tastes more like a cake. It's light and soft. It's delicious to the extreme.Muffins and Shuffles seem to be distinct, but they are all made up of eggs, sugar, flour and butter.The muffin is thick, dense, light and delicious. The secret of Shuffley's fluffy "whipping cream" is added to the muffin batter. After half-frying and half-steaming, the fluffy and fluffy Shuffle muffin, which is popular in Tokyo streets, is finished. Blueberry Mango Cheese muffin is very suitable for making desert after meals. It should be served quickly. The air-rich Shuffle muffin eats delicately and sweetly while it is hot.Blueberries have a sweet and sour taste.Shuffley muffins are super simple to make and can be found in your fridge!You kitchen gods, let's have a look together! ___________**
