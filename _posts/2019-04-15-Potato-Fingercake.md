First, peel the potatoes and slice them in a steaming pot. Steam them thoroughly.The yellow-hearted potatoes I use are easy to cook and steamed for 15 minutes.

## step 2:

Potatoes are pressed into mashed potatoes while they are hot.I like to use a bigger spoon, which is very pressing.

Flour and mashed potatoes are mixed in a ratio of one to one, and a box of pure milk is prepared.Add in little by little.You can adjust it to a shape.

Prepare flour, breadcrumbs and eggs.Spread a little flour on your hands.First rub the ball with your hand.Wrap flour, egg juice and breadcrumb in turn.When you want to get out of the pot, rub it into strips with your hands.

## step 5:

A little more rapeseed oil in the pot will be golden in color when fried with rapeseed oil. It looks better. The temperature of the oil is 5% hot.Blow him up.Fry one side and turn it over.

Slowly frying with a small fire can quickly turn over, both sides golden can be out of the pot.
