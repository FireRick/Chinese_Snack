When I got up this morning, I suddenly wanted to eat pumpkin pie, so I made a big plate of delicious pumpkin pie bald.Having made a fat circle of friends, a bunch of people are letting out recipes, and Super Brother will also write one by the way.**

## step 3:

Remove the pumpkin and put it in a large container. Mash it with a stick until it is muddy.Add proper amount of sugar, taste pumpkin puree is sweet, not too much sugar will be greasy.(If you like the taste of milk, you can add some milk powder or condensed milk)

## step 7:

The hot pan in the pan is oily, so the pumpkin cake can be fried without too high oil temperature.(Don't put too many at a time, four or five at a time, or they will stick to each other.) Pay attention to the opposite side in time, double-sided golden pot.
