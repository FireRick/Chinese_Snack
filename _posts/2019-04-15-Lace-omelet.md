## step 10:

Cut a small hole in the mouth of the mounted flower bag, don't cut too big, it will affect the effect of lace; don't stick the pan to open a small fire all the way, don't put oil, use the method of drawing circles, while squeezing paste while drawing circles;

## step 11:

The speed of squeezing into the egg paste is slightly faster.

After setting one side, turn it over and fry until it is slightly crisp, then roll it up in the pan and carefully scald it to your hands.

# Tips

1. Don't cut too much at the mouth of the mounting bag for extruding batter, otherwise the extruded lines will be very thick, which will affect the beauty.2. Must open a small fire all the way and bake slowly.
