# Introduction

**"Leaders are afraid of seeing such things as chicken feet, fish heads, chicken heads and shrimp heads. Every time they buy chicken feet, they always have a box facing down so that they won't see that the chicken feet they make are enjoyed by themselves and enjoyed at home. But the joyment of solo is not as good as the pleasure of the masses. So write and paste to share the pleasure of the masses. Just to mention, chopped peppers are their own pickled, mellow and delicious spices and seasonings for cooking.It's first class."**

# Tips

First, before frying the claws, we should absorb as much water as possible. When frying, we should pay attention to splashing oil, cover the body with a big pot and turn with long chopsticks. Then we can cover the cracks in the pot to let the hot vapor come out. After the water is fried dry, we can open the lid and turn the claws to fry the other side, which is much safer. Second, we need to fry the chopped peppers before the fragrance can be brought into full play, similar to the original "sauce does not fry fragrantly".Richard.
