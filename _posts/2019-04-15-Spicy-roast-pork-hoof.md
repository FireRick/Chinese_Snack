## step 7:

Boiled pig's hooves are taken out for reserve.I only boiled for about 30 minutes. Pig hooves are chewy. If you like to eat something softer, you can extend the time according to your taste and boil for 40-50 minutes.

## step 8:

Paving tin paper on the baking tray saves the time of washing the dishes.Then put the pig's hooves, sprinkle*red*chili powder, cumin powder, salt and pepper on the pig's hooves, and roast at 160 degrees for 10 minutes.
