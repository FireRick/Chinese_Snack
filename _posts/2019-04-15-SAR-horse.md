## step 8:

Pour the cooking oil into the pan and heat it until the oil temperature is about 150 C. Shake off the excess corn starch on the noodles and then fry it in succession until the noodles swell in a light golden color.(Test oil temperature method: can use a small noodle down to the oil pan, if noodles quickly float and expand, indicating that the oil temperature is OK.)

## step 9:

All the noodles are fried, oil-controlled, spare.

## step 11:

Boiling syrup: Fine granulated sugar, maltose, water put into the pot, small heat until the granulated sugar dissolves, the syrup appears dense bubbles.

## step 12:

Continue boiling over low heat until the syrup is 115 degrees.If there is no syrup thermometer, you can see that there are dense bubbles and the syrup is sticky and can be drawn.(Test with fried noodles, dip in a little syrup and pull out the filaments after cooling. The syrup is boiled.)

![step 12]({{site.baseurl}}/img/412434/12.jpg)

## step 13:

After the syrup is boiled, turn off the fire and quickly pour all the ingredients in step 10 into the pot. Mix well while it is hot, so that all the embryos are evenly dipped in the syrup as far as possible.
