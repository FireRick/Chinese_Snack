# Introduction

**"Last night, when I brushed a little red book, I was madly planted a huge Taiwanese delicacy, Maji Grandma's fresh milk Mazheng, which attracted 100,000 people to line up and punch in succession. Even I salivated at the screen and brushed my cell phone silently until dawn. This fresh milk Mazheng is Taiwan's net red dessert in Baodao. Unlike the traditional waxy rice Mazheng, fresh milk Mazheng is completely complete.The soft waxy sesame dumplings made by hand from pure fresh milk are wrapped in peanuts, sesame and like Q-shaped milk. The entrance is instant and the full fragrance of milk fills the mouth. It's absolute. As a genuine food, how can I let go of such delicious food?**

## step 5:

I have prepared a soybean flour here. I pour the cold-stored fresh milk and hemp dumplings on the soybean flour and roll them over.

## step 6:

When you eat, you press a small ball with your chopsticks and dip it in soybean powder, so you can put it in your mouth and taste it carefully.

## step 7:

You can change this soybean powder into sesame powder, peanut crumb, olio crumb or whatever. As long as you can think of it, you can try it. I changed it into black sesame, which is also very fragrant. And the fresh milk and sesame dumpling is very soft and waxy, but Hin is strong. After eating one, I want to have another one.~
