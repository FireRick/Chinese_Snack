# Steps

## step 1:

Peanut rice is packed in a cooking bowl and poured into boiling water that can submerge the peanut rice. There is no rule for boiling water, but it can be submerged. Why boiling water instead of cold water bubbles?The skin scalded with boiling water will wrinkle quickly and form a detachment state with peanuts and rice, however, it is easy to fall off.And the peanut with cold water blister will only slowly make the peanut rice full, so it is more difficult to make the peanut skin and peanut rice separated, so I used boiling water blanching oh.

## step 2:

After pouring boiling water, mix it quickly with chopsticks. Then you will see that some peanut peels have begun to come out. The advantage of fast mixing with chopsticks is that it is easier to peel.
