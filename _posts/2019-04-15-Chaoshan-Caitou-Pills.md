# Tips

1. Caotou pills are more fire-eating and quick-burning in appearance, so they should be low-fired and slow-fried, and the shape of the pills should not be too large to ensure that they are thoroughly cooked in the middle.2. Attention should be paid to stirring the pills after steaming to prevent adhesion.Fish while frying, cook first, and avoid scorching.3. If the oil level in the pan is too shallow, the fried balls will turn into flat cakes.If you want to make an oil-saving version, you can flatten it and fry it into a small cake.
