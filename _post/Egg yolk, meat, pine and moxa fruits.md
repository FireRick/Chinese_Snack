## Tips

Glutinous rice must be rubbed with "boiling water" and mugwort must be thoroughly boiled, so it is more appropriate to rub with bread machine or chef machine; when rubbing noodles, if you feel too wet, add glutinous rice flour (I add 50g more than the weighing 500g) and feel sticky, you can put some oil on your hands, or clean the sticky noodles in your hands, and then continue to wrap them.
